					<description><![CDATA[Hi Noah--

I received word of your post via LinkedIn and was very happy about it.  I also have to say that your video both touched and moved me very much.  And I could not have agreed more with the sentiments you expressed.  I hope you and your family are enjoying a glorious New England summer. Truth be told, I am more than a little jealous (though I do not begrudge you one moment of joy).  My time will come soon enough.  What am I saying?  My time is virtually here--this retirement gig is great.  But, when Anne-Marie has finished in Super Court, I expect we too shall. be heading northward.  Homeward bound.  Until then or whenever, stay safe.  All the best, Craig]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is very beautifully written, I had such a hard time during mass on Sunday as feelings or worry, sadness, stress and anger became overwhelming during the opening song, “Why have you abandoned me?” It warms my heart to read your reflection and remember we have to have moments of pain so we appreciate the joy.  It reminds me of flying to NYC and picking you and sweet baby Wiley up for Uncle Jim’s funeral, and the risk and fear of that rental car with bad brakes all the way to G’ville.  So worth all of it for the feeling of home. XO!]]></description>
