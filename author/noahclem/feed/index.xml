<p>Caroline&#8217;s <a href="/2019/06/11/taking-a-moment-to-reflect/">reminiscences</a> about our children&#8217;s baptisms really threw me for a loop. It&#8217;s hard for me to look at all the pictures of our children when they were younger without tears coming to my eyes. The sweet pain of nostalgia makes me wonder whether I was a good enough father to my beautiful young children; am I a good enough father now? I have written about this <a href="/2019/03/18/building-connection-can-estate-planning-improve-relationships/">before:</a> for me, looking at old pictures creates a &#8220;twinge in your heart far more powerful than memory alone . . . it takes us to a place where we ache to go again.&#8221;  <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="- Don Draper (opens in a new tab)" href="https://youtu.be/suRDUFpsHus" target="_blank">&#8211; Don Draper</a></p>

<p>Where I am now with this is that I am grateful that I got to be there, that I got to see them, that I got to hold them. I am grateful that I still get to see my children. They are still beautiful, but it&#8217;s hard to see them as children now. They are really grown up. My son Eric is taller, bigger, smarter than I am. I can&#8217;t wait to see what he does when he decides what he wants to do. </p>



<p>My daughter Wiley is about to graduate from college early (EARLY!!???! Whose daughter is she?). She is going to be a novelist. She has known she will be a writer for as long as she has known there are books.</p>



<p>My other daughter Elise is the most mature high-schooler ever. She has a job, she volunteers, she goes to church, she&#8217;s taking AP classes, and she cooks dinner for her parents. She is more self-assured than anyone I know.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/theclementsfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wiley-Fishing-chesapeake.jpg?resize=249%2C332&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-1707" width="249" height="332" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theclementsfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wiley-Fishing-chesapeake.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/theclementsfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wiley-Fishing-chesapeake.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Wiley fishing</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I am just glad I get to know them. And they are happy to have us around. Still, when I look at the old pictures, I miss their younger selves. I can&#8217;t help it. </p>



<p>Here is the part where I tie this into the business. I am on a mission to help people make sure their families are taken care of and free from conflict when something happens to them.  </p>



<p>If you’re the parent of minor children, your most important planning task is to legally document guardians to care for your kids in the event of your death or incapacity. These are the people whom you trust to care for your children—and potentially raise them to adulthood—if something should happen to you.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/theclementsfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2018.07.07-NWEE-wedding-GJ-laughing.jpg?resize=255%2C182&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-1709" width="255" height="182" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theclementsfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2018.07.07-NWEE-wedding-GJ-laughing.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i0.wp.com/theclementsfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2018.07.07-NWEE-wedding-GJ-laughing.jpg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/theclementsfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2018.07.07-NWEE-wedding-GJ-laughing.jpg?resize=768%2C549&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Luckily, we have been able to have this conversation with my sister-in-law. Since my brother passed, if something happened to her, my niece and nephew would need a guardian, and without planning, that decision would be made by the court. Caroline and I would certainly step in. But my sister-in-law let us know that she would want her sister to raise the children &#8211; it is very important to her that they be raised bilingual and Catholic. We are thrilled that she let us know &#8211; we know we would still be a part of their lives. And knowing more about my sister-in-law&#8217;s priorities helps us have a deeper connection with her.  </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The best time to plant a tree is 25 years ago, the second-best time is right now.</p><cite>Supposedly, an ancient Chinese proverb, but who knows?</cite></blockquote>



<p>It can be overwhelming. Figuring out how to get the care and services for your special needs child is incredibly difficult; figuring out how to pay for it can be even more difficult. And then add in the effort of being a caregiver. The prospect of planning to provide for all of your child&#8217;s needs when something happens can be scary. How are you going to do it?</p>



<p>First, let&#8217;s not freak out too much. Yes, there are many things to think about, <a href="/services/special-needs-planning/">estate planning</a> techniques we can help you with, etc. But we can also just start where we are. Why not just start with opening an ABLE account? You don&#8217;t need a lawyer for that.</p>



<p>ABLE stands for Achieving a Better Life Experience (cool acronym) and an ABLE account is basically a special kind of state-run investment account that allows families of people with special needs to save money for them, and grow it tax-free, without jeopardizing their ability to receive government benefits. What 529 accounts are to college savings, ABLE accounts are to special needs. Florida&#8217;s ABLE account is called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ABLE United (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ableunited.com/" target="_blank">ABLE United</a> and you can find out about it <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ABLE United (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ableunited.com/" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>



<p>As I said above, the earnings in ABLE accounts grow tax-free, and some states will allow a tax-deduction for contributions to those states&#8217; ABLE plans. That doesn&#8217;t help Florida residents as we have no state income tax, but if you have family members in a state like <a href="https://mi.db101.org/mi/programs/job_planning/able/program.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Michigan (opens in a new tab)">Michigan</a>, which does, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="which allows tax deductions for ABLE account contributions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.miable.org/FAQ.php#Question13" target="_blank">which allows tax deductions for ABLE account contributions</a>, they can get a tax deduction for helping provide for your special needs child.</p>



<p>As I noted above, you don&#8217;t need a <a href="/services/special-needs-planning/">special needs </a>or <a href="/services/estate-planning/">estate planning</a> lawyer to set up an ABLE account. That said, we are here to help.</p>

<p>My grandpa passed away on the afternoon of Friday, March 29, 2019. He was 94 years old. Luckily, I was able to go out and see him earlier that week when he came home from the hospital into home hospice care. It was a truly magical moment when all my cousins and I were singing songs to my Grandpa that night. He lived a full and complete life. </p>



<p>As was printed in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the official obituary (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/statesman/obituary.aspx?n=sidney-monas&amp;pid=192100617" target="_blank">the official obituary</a> today, &#8220;this is not Sidney&#8217;s first obituary. . .&#8221; Cue ominous music. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In May 1945 when he returned home from internment as a POW in Germany, the twenty-year old Sidney learned that his hometown paper had published an account of his death during the Battle of the Bulge. But Sid was one of the lucky few who were captured, shipped to Germany, and survived until being liberated by General Patton&#8217;s army. He returned to&nbsp;Princeton University&nbsp;to resume the education that had been interrupted by the war he saw as &#8220;the fundamental uniting experience of my generation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>I feel like I knew my grandpa pretty well, as we&#8217;re a close family and I went to college where he taught, but I did not know that. I do remember his stories of being a Jew held captive by the German Army and having to fight some of his fellow American soldiers because he was Jewish.   </p>



<p>But mostly what I remember was his love of knowledge and his love of great food and travel. He had what my daughter calls a &#8220;wandering eye.&#8221; When he was deep in his career, he mostly loved to talk about intellectual matters &#8211; when I was in college, I would yank his chain while we played chess by talking to him about &#8220;Creationism.&#8221; I once brought him an evangelist-creationist comic-book; that was fun. He was a lot more fun to have fun with than his father &#8211; Grandpa Dave &#8211; who cooked a mean borscht, but had no humor about frivolous matters.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/theclementsfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Painting-of-Grandpa.jpg?resize=366%2C282&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-1528" width="366" height="282" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theclementsfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Painting-of-Grandpa.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i0.wp.com/theclementsfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Painting-of-Grandpa.jpg?resize=300%2C232&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/theclementsfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Painting-of-Grandpa.jpg?resize=768%2C593&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/theclementsfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Painting-of-Grandpa.jpg?resize=350%2C270&amp;ssl=1 350w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Unknown artist painting of Grandpa<br></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>My grandfather certainly passed on a love of reading to me. I have always been incredibly proud that he translated Crime and Punishment. Because of him, I have read most of Doestoyevsky&#8217;s novels, Tolstoy, Bulgokov, Turgeñev, and tried to read James Joyce. My grandfather truly loved Joyce &#8211; and could often be heard quoting from Finnegan&#8217;s Wake in what he thought was an Irish brogue.</p>



<p>As he got older, he was much more a pure lover of fun &#8211; more available to children and childish pleasures. Singing silly children&#8217;s songs. And that&#8217;s how I will remember him best.</p>

<p>Caroline has been weeding out old pictures. There&#8217;s a good reason for it: we don&#8217;t have much room and the picture books are falling apart. But looking through old pictures of family and friends can stir bittersweet feelings of love and loss. Mad Men&#8217;s Don Draper had it right: family pictures spin us &#8220;around and around and back home again to a place where we know we are loved.&#8221; </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re like me, when looking at old pictures, you’re likely reminded of just how important our relationships are. And as we grow older, you begin to realize how precious little time we have to spend with one another.</p>



<p>For me, the big wakeup call was after our oldest daughter started high school. I felt like I had very little personal relationship with her and knew that she would be leaving home in just a few short years. I really wanted to have my own connection with our children, not just through Caroline. </p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure many fathers are better about it. But I didn&#8217;t feel like I had that connection, even though I went to all school events, was around, etc. Luckily, I got the advice to start setting individual dates/outings with each of my children. At these dates, we would do whatever <em>they</em> wanted, not just inviting them to what I thought would be fun. And I started driving them around to their stuff, even if sometimes it drives me crazy. I have come to understand that &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ahaparenting.com/parenting-tools/connection/building-relationship" target="_blank">quality time is a myth, because there’s no switch to turn on closeness</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>An older friend told me recently that he thought that we&#8217;re never as close with our children as when we just listen to them, without judgment. Caroline recently <a href="/2019/03/13/what-is-family/">wrote about family</a> and it got me thinking about how our work fits into that vision. A large part of my efforts to improve my relationships is to be more open in my relationships and all my communications. And my training in estate planning is a large part of that. </p>



<p>The <a href="/services/estate-planning/">estate planning</a> coaches I use wrote about 4 ways that they claim estate planning can improve relationships with your loved ones. They claim that not only do we &#8220;experience a huge sense of relief and peace,&#8221; knowing we have put a comprehensive plan in place, but that &#8220;estate planning also has the potential to enhance your relationship with loved ones in some major ways.&#8221; They say</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>the [estate planning] process can be the ultimate forum for heartfelt communication and prioritizing what matters most in life. Indeed, communicating clearly about what you want to happen in the event of your incapacity or death (and asking your loved ones what they want to happen) can foster a deeper bond and sense of intimacy than just about anything else you can do.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Who doesn&#8217;t want that? So let&#8217;s look at the claims and see if estate planning can improve the relationships we cherish most:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>1) It shows you sincerely care</strong></p>



<p>Taking the time and effort to carefully plan for what will happen to you in the event of your incapacity or when you die is a genuine demonstration of your love. It would be far easier to do nothing and simply let you family and friends figure it out for themselves. After all, you won’t be around to deal with any of the fallout.</p>



<p>Planning in advance, though, shows that you truly care about the welfare of your loved ones, even when you’re no longer around to benefit from their love and companionship.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Some people truly don&#8217;t want to be bothered about what will happen to their families after they&#8217;re gone. Perversely, there are some who relish the thought of their loved ones fighting over their assets when they are gone (as if they were fighting over them). And some can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t face the prospect of being incapacitated, and what that would mean for the people who care for them. My father used to say &#8220;I won&#8217;t be a burden, just put me out in a small boat so I can sail off.&#8221; As if that was some type of realistic plan. But that&#8217;s not us &#8211; and it&#8217;s not you if you&#8217;re reading this. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>2) It inspires honest communication about difficult issues</strong></p>



<p>Sitting down and having an honest discussion about life’s most taboo subjects—incapacity and death—is almost certain to bring you and your loved ones closer. By forcing you to face mortality together, planning has a way of highlighting what’s really important in life—and what’s not. </p>



<p>In fact, the estate planning process can help you feel more connected with the people you love the most. And planning helps clarify for many people the lives they want to live during the short time we have here on earth.  </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Both of these things have certainly happened for me. While these discussions can be uncomfortable, I think our relationships benefit from being open about our feelings and intentions. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>3) It builds a deep sense of trust and respect</strong></p>



<p>Whether it’s the individuals you name as your children’s legal guardians or those you nominate to handle your own end-of-life care, estate planning shows your loved ones just how much you trust and admire them. . . .</p>



<p>Though it’s often challenging to verbally express how much you love your family and friends, estate planning demonstrates your affection in a truly tangible way. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>I think this is a beautiful sentiment. Sometimes the guardians chosen may not want the responsibility &#8211; and make no mistake, it is a great responsibility. But in those cases, it is better to know beforehand. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>4) It creates a lasting legacy</strong></p>



<p>Estate planning is primarily viewed as a way to pass on your financial wealth and property. However, it can offer your loved ones much more than just financial security. When done right, it lets you hand down the most precious assets of all—your life stories, lessons, and values.</p>



<p>In fact, the wisdom and experience you’ve gained during your lifetime are among the most treasured gifts you can give. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>When it comes to legacy, I believe that the examples we set speak louder than any words we can say. There&#8217;s no substitute for creating memories. My family is lucky to have members in it who have put in a lot of effort to put together letters and memory books. Caroline often creates photo books for family members as gifts. However, I also wish I had recordings of my parents, my brother, and other loved ones who have passed. </p>



<p>So we have developed a service to help pass on our legacy. With this service, we guide you to create a recording in which you share your most insightful memories and experiences.  </p>



<p><strong>The heart of the matter</strong><br>We can help guide and support you in having these intimate discussions with your loved ones. Planning can enrich your family and friends with far more than just material wealth.</p>



<p>With our help, <strong><a href="/services/estate-planning/">estate planning </a></strong>doesn’t have to be a dreary affair. When done right, it&#8217;s more about putting your life and relationships in clearer focus. Ultimately planning can be a tremendously uplifting experience for everyone involved.

<p>Last Tuesday was the first anniversary of my brother&#8217;s death and Saturday was his birthday. His wife (I still have trouble with &#8220;widow&#8221;) threw a party at the last restaurant he managed &#8211; Monty&#8217;s in the Grove. It was a lovely party with  family and friends. Last year, right after Michael&#8217;s death, his best friend Shawn threw a birthday party for him at the Coral Reef Yacht club &#8211; it was a time for stories about Michael. Some were funny, some were sad, and some were in poor taste. But that&#8217;s what we needed. We all wanted something to hold on to.</p>



<p>Some things aren&#8217;t meant to be moved on from. This year there were fewer Michael-stories, but more discussions about how everyone was dealing &#8211; how our own lives had changed. Michael&#8217;s family moved to a new house where life will be hopefully easier &#8211; with more children running around and more support. Others have also taken action to spend more time with family as the central part of their lifestyle. </p>



<p>That&#8217;s certainly been part of Caroline and my story since Michael&#8217;s death. After the funeral, we went back up to Silver Spring, where we were living. But then in dealing with our day-to-day and plans for the future, we realized we could not go on as if nothing had happened. My own plans for a new house, for example, just felt so self-indulgent all of a sudden. After ensuring that it would actually be helpful to Michael&#8217;s wife Melissa, we came down to be more of a part of her life and the kids&#8217; lives. And we decided to work together. </p>



<p>Although the impetus for these changes is almost unbearably sad, we have enjoyed the results immensely. I love getting to know Melissa and her family better; I love playing with my niece and nephew so often; and I love spending more time with my own wife and children. When dealing with this kind of pain there can be only one cure &#8211; that&#8217;s more love.</p>



<h2>Eulogy for Michael</h2>



<p>For those who are interested, I am including my eulogy for Michael:</p>



<p>Michael truly was a loving person who was loved by all who knew him &#8211; and this started at an early age.</p>



<p>I remember when we were in elementary school, the two beautiful young stewardesses who lived in the apartment downstairs just doted on him. I remember the Israeli drug dealer our mother was dating at the time would occasionally pause from his general yelling, stroke his chin, look at Michael, and say &#8220;this is a manly child&#8221;.</p>



<p>It was during this time that Michael developed his life-long love for the music of the Bee-Gees. You simply have not seen dancing until you&#8217;ve seen Michael dancing to &#8220;Staying Alive&#8221;.</p>



<p>And Michael was involved in the lives of the people around him &#8211; when he managed a local restaurant chain, he knew details of the lives of every one of the 300 people who worked for him.</p>



<p>And he was generous. When he felt that the company he worked for did not sufficiently reward the people who worked there, he took his own money to make sure they knew he appreciated them. Michael knew that success is a team effort.</p>



<p>And he loved his family.</p>



<p>I remember Michael visiting us when our 1st daughter was born &#8211; he brought all seven dwarves with him, life sized. And he bought out the entire stuffed animal inventory of FAO Schwartz.</p>



<p>When our son was born, he brought a Minnie Mouse that was bigger than him &#8211; I think he had to buy an extra plane seat for that Minnie.</p>



<p>Michael wanted nothing more than to start a family of his own.</p>



<p>And he did. But Michael suffered unspeakable tragedy when his pregnant wife Ashley died in a car accident.</p>



<p>We were all devastated. Michael sank into a depression so deep that we could have lost him then. But Michael&#8217;s love for his family pulled him through.</p>



<p>Michael took in our father and cared for him when he lost his bout with lung cancer. And Michael cared for our Mother when she had her long fight to receive two lung transplants.</p>



<p>Both of these times Michael had Melissa by his side.</p>



<p>Now I&#8217;m not the best person to tell you of the romantic saga of Michael&#8217;s love for Melissa, but I can tell you that I know she was very important to him from the beginning.</p>



<p>And I can tell you that she saved Michael from dying from his unbearable heartbreak.</p>



<p>And since he married you, Melissa, and since you two had this beautiful wild Antonella, and this incredible happy boy Peter, Michael has been the happiest man in the world. You made him so happy.</p>



<p>The last words Michael wrote were to Antonella [he wanted to write to each of you, but he couldn&#8217;t] [I had the original paper at the time, but it is now with Melissa. This is the best I can remember]:</p>



<p>&#8220;I have loved the thought of you for as long as I can remember. You have made me cry tears of incredible joy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Enough of this lovey-dovey stuff.</p>



<p>Michael truly wanted the best for everyone around him. I know everyone here who knew Michael can tell a story about how Michael went out of his way to make your life better.</p>



<p>So I am going to ask you all to do something.</p>



<p>Tell each other, tell me: how did Michael touch you, help you, make your life better.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s not stop telling each other these stories.</p>



<p>We need to keep Michael here, because he was taken from us way too soon.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very lucky in that I get to learn so much from Caroline on our walks. Because Caroline has been on the road for the last week, however, we haven&#8217;t had our Beach Walk for a while. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>



<p>Strangely, I had a dream while she was traveling that sort of gave me a Caroline-type-message anyway. Like the dream world looking out for me while she was gone.  Anyway, in this dream, I was in a Miami Beach rec center (reminded me of Flamingo park around 40 years ago) and no one was playing. Everyone was sitting around doing nothing. So I asked this old woman with white hair if she wanted to play foosball. Somehow, I knew she was really good. </p>



<p><span id="more-844"></span></p>



<p>As soon as we go over to the table, I put the quarters in. It&#8217;s a big table and a crowd forms quickly. A teenager calls next and for some reason I am very wary of him. As we&#8217;re playing, I feel like I can&#8217;t move the rods that control the &#8220;players&#8221; freely. It  feels like people &#8211; kids &#8211; are grabbing onto the other sides of the rods and hindering their movement. </p>



<p>I complain. The woman says nothing, keeps playing, but the crowd jeers at me. I&#8217;m looking under the table; it seems like the kids who were grabbing onto my rods were hiding. I&#8217;m having a horrible time &#8211; my feelings are hurt that everyone wants me to lose. I eventually do lose the game, and the crowd cheers. </p>



<p>The next game starts and everyone is having a great time except me. I have really hurt feelings. I go over to these couches with a book to try and calm down. This man with dark hair comes and sits next to me. He asked me if I knew why everyone was on the woman&#8217;s side; why they wanted her to win; why they were having fun playing with her? And why they wanted me to lose, and even tried to make me lose? He said: &#8220;you&#8217;re too serious. You wanted to win too much.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was defensive and fumed: &#8220;She&#8217;s good and wants to win too!&#8221; &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t even know if she can beat me without people trying to sabotage me!&#8221; Whine, moan. </p>



<p>He said &#8220;yes, she&#8217;s good, but she doesn&#8217;t really care if she wins. She just loves to play. You need to just enjoy the game.&#8221;</p>



<p>I woke up sad, but then I realized this dream was really a message to me. I need to stop caring so much about winning or losing, but enjoy the game. What a gift.  </p>

<p>One of the best things about starting this estate planning practice with my wife Caroline in Miami is that we decided to have our staff meetings at the beach before going into the office. It takes away much of the stress.</p>



<p>This morning, as we were talking about my endless list of things we need to do, Caroline said something that just hit me in the gut: &#8220;Sometimes we disguise our fear as overwhelm and indecision. As we act, the fear goes away. We can just start where we are and adjust as we go.&#8221; Ouch! </p>



<p><span id="more-677"></span></p>



<p>She reminded me of our own journey with estate planning: when our first daughter was born, we wanted to put a plan together, but then we moved down to North Carolina. We had our son a year later, and put in a barebones plan and got some insurance. We didn&#8217;t change anything when our third child was born because things were in flux; I started law school and who knew where we would be after that? Then when my brother&#8217;s wife died and we needed new guardians for our kids, we said we would change after we moved to D.C. But there was always something in the future that we were waiting for.  Something that would be settled.  </p>



<p>Our lives are still not &#8220;settled.&#8221; Life happens. Kids go to college, other cherished family members pass away. My mother and my brother both passed away fairly recently without any estate plan whatsoever, even though both knew that they had fatal diseases. My brother&#8217;s passing is why we are here in Miami and why I changed my practice to estate planning.</p>



<p>My brother tried to scramble to put a plan in place before he died way too soon. He was always going to create a plan when he knew what was going to happen. What we were waiting for was the fear to leave. Now I know that the best plan is the one you have put in place. As we know more, we can always adjust later.</p>

<blockquote><p>L4LM: It sounds like the best answer, when dealing with the cops, is to just say no.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="background-color: #e8f0f5;">CB: (Chuckles) Yeah. I always tell people in interactions with police officers is be pleasant, be polite, don&#8217;t run away or do anything stupid. But always keep in the back of your mind that your position is &#8220;I don&#8217;t agree to be searched. I&#8217;d like to leave if I can. Am I being detained?&#8221; Don&#8217;t make a statement. Basically there&#8217;s nothing you can do at that point if you&#8217;re under investigation that can help you. All you can do is hurt yourself and make it easier for the police officers.</span></p>
