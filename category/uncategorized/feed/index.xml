<p>My grandpa passed away on the afternoon of Friday, March 29, 2019. He was 94 years old. Luckily, I was able to go out and see him earlier that week when he came home from the hospital into home hospice care. It was a truly magical moment when all my cousins and I were singing songs to my Grandpa that night. He lived a full and complete life. </p>



<p>As was printed in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the official obituary (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/statesman/obituary.aspx?n=sidney-monas&amp;pid=192100617" target="_blank">the official obituary</a> today, &#8220;this is not Sidney&#8217;s first obituary. . .&#8221; Cue ominous music. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In May 1945 when he returned home from internment as a POW in Germany, the twenty-year old Sidney learned that his hometown paper had published an account of his death during the Battle of the Bulge. But Sid was one of the lucky few who were captured, shipped to Germany, and survived until being liberated by General Patton&#8217;s army. He returned to&nbsp;Princeton University&nbsp;to resume the education that had been interrupted by the war he saw as &#8220;the fundamental uniting experience of my generation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>I feel like I knew my grandpa pretty well, as we&#8217;re a close family and I went to college where he taught, but I did not know that. I do remember his stories of being a Jew held captive by the German Army and having to fight some of his fellow American soldiers because he was Jewish.   </p>



<p>But mostly what I remember was his love of knowledge and his love of great food and travel. He had what my daughter calls a &#8220;wandering eye.&#8221; When he was deep in his career, he mostly loved to talk about intellectual matters &#8211; when I was in college, I would yank his chain while we played chess by talking to him about &#8220;Creationism.&#8221; I once brought him an evangelist-creationist comic-book; that was fun. He was a lot more fun to have fun with than his father &#8211; Grandpa Dave &#8211; who cooked a mean borscht, but had no humor about frivolous matters.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/theclementsfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Painting-of-Grandpa.jpg?resize=366%2C282&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-1528" width="366" height="282" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theclementsfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Painting-of-Grandpa.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i0.wp.com/theclementsfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Painting-of-Grandpa.jpg?resize=300%2C232&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/theclementsfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Painting-of-Grandpa.jpg?resize=768%2C593&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/theclementsfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Painting-of-Grandpa.jpg?resize=350%2C270&amp;ssl=1 350w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Unknown artist painting of Grandpa<br></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>My grandfather certainly passed on a love of reading to me. I have always been incredibly proud that he translated Crime and Punishment. Because of him, I have read most of Doestoyevsky&#8217;s novels, Tolstoy, Bulgokov, Turgeñev, and tried to read James Joyce. My grandfather truly loved Joyce &#8211; and could often be heard quoting from Finnegan&#8217;s Wake in what he thought was an Irish brogue.</p>



<p>As he got older, he was much more a pure lover of fun &#8211; more available to children and childish pleasures. Singing silly children&#8217;s songs. And that&#8217;s how I will remember him best.</p>

<p><em>The children look so sweet dancing in the waves<br />

</em><i>Stretched out back behind us we leave footprints in the sand;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>It is often truly said that many of our best lawyers . . . are withdrawing from court practice because the nature of the litigation is changing. To such an extent is this change taking place in some localities that the more important commercial cases rarely reach a court decision. Our merchants prefer to compromise their difficulties, or to write off their losses, rather than enter into litigations that must remain dormant in the courts for upward of three years awaiting their turn for a hearing on the overcrowded court calendars.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>When the public realizes that a good trial lawyer is the outcome, one might say of generations of witnesses, when clients fully appreciate the dangers they run in intrusting their litigations to so-called “office lawyers&#8221; with little or no experience in court, they will insist upon their briefs being intrusted to those who make a specialty of court practice. . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Francis Wellman,&nbsp;<em>The Art of Cross-Examination</em> 1904.</p>
