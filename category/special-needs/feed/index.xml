<p>It can be overwhelming. Figuring out how to get the care and services for your special needs child is incredibly difficult; figuring out how to pay for it can be even more difficult. And then add in the effort of being a caregiver. The prospect of planning to provide for all of your child&#8217;s needs when something happens can be scary. How are you going to do it?</p>



<p>First, let&#8217;s not freak out too much. Yes, there are many things to think about, <a href="/services/special-needs-planning/">estate planning</a> techniques we can help you with, etc. But we can also just start where we are. Why not just start with opening an ABLE account? You don&#8217;t need a lawyer for that.</p>



<p>ABLE stands for Achieving a Better Life Experience (cool acronym) and an ABLE account is basically a special kind of state-run investment account that allows families of people with special needs to save money for them, and grow it tax-free, without jeopardizing their ability to receive government benefits. What 529 accounts are to college savings, ABLE accounts are to special needs. Florida&#8217;s ABLE account is called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ABLE United (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ableunited.com/" target="_blank">ABLE United</a> and you can find out about it <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ABLE United (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ableunited.com/" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>



<p>As I said above, the earnings in ABLE accounts grow tax-free, and some states will allow a tax-deduction for contributions to those states&#8217; ABLE plans. That doesn&#8217;t help Florida residents as we have no state income tax, but if you have family members in a state like <a href="https://mi.db101.org/mi/programs/job_planning/able/program.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Michigan (opens in a new tab)">Michigan</a>, which does, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="which allows tax deductions for ABLE account contributions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.miable.org/FAQ.php#Question13" target="_blank">which allows tax deductions for ABLE account contributions</a>, they can get a tax deduction for helping provide for your special needs child.</p>



<p>As I noted above, you don&#8217;t need a <a href="/services/special-needs-planning/">special needs </a>or <a href="/services/estate-planning/">estate planning</a> lawyer to set up an ABLE account. That said, we are here to help.</p>
