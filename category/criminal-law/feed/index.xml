<p><span style="background-color: #e8f0f5;">CB: (Chuckles) Yeah. I always tell people in interactions with police officers is be pleasant, be polite, don&#8217;t run away or do anything stupid. But always keep in the back of your mind that your position is &#8220;I don&#8217;t agree to be searched. I&#8217;d like to leave if I can. Am I being detained?&#8221; Don&#8217;t make a statement. Basically there&#8217;s nothing you can do at that point if you&#8217;re under investigation that can help you. All you can do is hurt yourself and make it easier for the police officers.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s what everyone says they want &#8211; a pitbull on their side. I like pitbulls &#8211; they are intelligent, loving animals. However, that&#8217;s not the image that most people have in mind when thinking of lawyers or what they want &#8211; the picture that comes to mind is a vicious, dangerous killer that will not let go once it sets its teeth in. In the courtroom, this plays out as an attacking, caustic style, one I think is usually counterproductive.</p>
<p>The New York Times has a couple of pieces on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/world/africa/oscar-pistorius-murder-trial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the prosecutor</a> in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/world/africa/pistorius-murder-trial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oscar Pistorious trial</a> (I almost wrote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2dtEXzbKyU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaco Pastorius</a> &#8211; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjS9Y-T589g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he&#8217;s a different kind of killer</a>), who has earned <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/world/africa/oscar-pistorius-murder-trial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">t</a>he nickname &#8220;Pit Bull.&#8221; His style has been described as &#8220;pugnacious&#8221; with &#8220;a reputation for abrasive, in-your-face cross-examination,&#8221; by turns &#8220;sarcastic, theatrical, skeptical and accusatory.&#8221; He has at times called the defendant a liar while testifying. Does this work?</p>
<p><iframe id="nyt_video_player" title="New York Times Video - Embed Player" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/bcvideo/1.0/iframe/embed.html?videoId=100000002818275&amp;playerType=embed" height="373" width="480" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span id="more-569"></span></p>
<p>While Mr. Pistorious may end up convicted, I don&#8217;t think it will be because of the prosecutor&#8217;s &#8220;pitbull&#8221; cross-examination style. At one point in the trial, the judge reprimanded the prosecutor for &#8220;snickering&#8221; at the defendant&#8217;s answer, stating “You possibly think this is entertainment. It is not.” The judge has also warned him to stop calling Mr. Pistorious a liar while he is testifying (this would be grounds for a mistrial in the US). And the  South African Human Rights Commission has received a complaint that the prosecutor&#8217;s &#8220;persistent depiction of Mr. Pistorius as a liar infringed on the runner’s right to be presumed innocent and to have a fair trial.&#8221; (Only one?)</p>
<p>Look at the <a href="http://nyti.ms/1qxOWER" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">short video clip excerpt</a> of the second-day of cross-examination of Mr. Pistorious &#8211; do you think it&#8217;s effective? I thought Mr. Pistorious ended up looking much more sympathetic than he would have without the question.</p>
<p>Terry MacCarthy in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/MacCarthy-Cross-Examination-Terence/dp/1590318862/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1397424991&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=maccarthy+on+cross+examination" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his book </a>on cross-examination says that while defendants and their families may appreciate the attacking cross, the jury &#8220;is muttering to themselves: &#8216;That guy [meaning you] is an ass.&#8221; A prosecutor may get away with it against a defendant, who is seen as deserving this treatment by dint of getting prosecuted. But it doesn&#8217;t seem to work for criminal defense lawyers except against the snitch.</p>
<p>There is a place for determined, aggressive work in criminal defense &#8211; in preparation. Just remember, vicious creatures get put down.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> My friend Jamison Koehler has a great post along the same lines on &#8220;<a href="http://koehlerlaw.net/2014/04/on-the-benefits-of-restraint-during-cross-examination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Benefits of Restraint During Cross-Examination.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p><b>2nd UPDATE: </b>Master criminal defense lawyer Roy Black has <a href="http://www.royblack.com/blog/the-bull-dog-cross/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an entirely different view</a> of the Pistorius cross-examination. Black says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nel is a sarcastic SOB which I enjoy so long as he is not assaulting one of my clients. I have never seen a prosecutor as skilled in the art, but remember this was a judge trial. No rational prosecutor could do an assault like this in front of a jury. They would see it as too over bearing and smack of inspector Javert, but you can’t beat this for pure sadistic enjoyment.</p>
<p>. . . And his method is easy to grasp: He challenges every detail of the story, every claim, every dodge, every obfuscation.</p></blockquote>
<p>While it&#8217;s easy to see why my experiences in bullying a witness can differ from a prosecutor&#8217;s (i.e., the perception that the defendant deserves it), when Roy Black speaks or writes about cross-examination, it&#8217;s a good idea to pay attention. Black&#8217;s post is well worth studying to determine whether any of the techniques used by the prosecutor can be applied by a defense lawyer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many consequences to a drug conviction, some well-known and others not obvious until you face it. One little-known consequence of a drug conviction in DC is that the DC Department of Motor Vehicles will automatically revoke your driver&#8217;s license. DC Code §&nbsp;50-1403.02 requires the DMV to revoke DC driving privileges for any adult or juvenile conviction (or what they call in the juvenile system &#8220;adjudication&#8221;) for a drug offense. This is true whether the drug charge had anything to do with driving or whether you even have a driver&#8217;s license.*<span id="more-552"></span></p>
<p>Unlike many other reasons that the DMV will revoke or suspend a driver&#8217;s license, this provision does not provide for any notice to be given before the revocation (even though taking away a person&#8217;s license without notice is a violation of due process). And many lawyers don&#8217;t tell their clients that they will lose their license if they plead guilty to a drug charge. They should.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions: DC&#8217;s probation before judgment for first offenders under DC Code § 48-904.01(e) and a guilty plea under a deferred sentencing agreement are not considered convictions and should not lead to license revocation.</p>
<p>All in all, this is just another reason to think hard about taking a misdemeanor drug charge to trial rather than pleading guilty. There&#8217;s no such thing as an unwinnable case.</p>
<p>*If you don&#8217;t have a driver&#8217;s license, since there is nothing to take away, the statute says that this will delay the availability of a license for up to two years</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was feeling very confident: the two police officers the prosecutor put on admitted that they had no reasonable articulable suspicion of any crime, let alone probable cause, to justify keeping my client in handcuffs on the side of the road for a half hour before checking to see whether he had any outstanding warrants. The judge would just have to find that illegal (and suppress the evidence allegedly found after the arrest when a warrant was found). And it didn&#8217;t faze me that the judge asked for additional post-hearing briefing. The law was on my side, the facts were on my side, the prosecutor couldn&#8217;t do anything. He didn&#8217;t have to. At the next hearing the judge held that the half-hour in handcuffs did not unnecessarily prolong the initially lawful stop.</p>
<p>Every <del>trial</del> criminal defense lawyer knows this feeling, as eloquently described by <a href="http://blog.simplejustice.us/2013/12/16/creating-law-talking-guys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Greenfield</a>: &#8220;we stand there helpless as judges mangle words, if not concepts, waving them off with an imperial flip of the hand as if the hundred years of caselaw never happened.&#8221; And sometimes judges who know the exact words of the standards by heart will proclaim that the standard does or doesn&#8217;t apply, contrary to all precedent.</p>
<p>But then there are times when the judge will reconsider as we jump back in and show the judge why they should, must rule for our client. And other times when the judge&#8217;s apparent &#8220;no&#8221; or &#8220;that can&#8217;t be right&#8221; is a request to dig deeper, to explain further, to show why this is the right result. Nothing ever bad happened to a lawyer who respectfully asked to be heard. And then sometimes we win. So we hope. And we fight, but not in anger. And even if we lose one battle, the war is not necessarily over.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The lesson from the jury was clear: while they believed that there were too many discrepancies and inconsistencies in the police officers&#8217; stories to convict our client of evidence tampering (whew! one felony avoided), they couldn&#8217;t go the rest of the way to believing that the police officers planted drugs on the defendant (damn, a felony possession conviction). It&#8217;s not surprising really. We all want to believe that the people entrusted to protect us are good and honest.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they&#8217;re not, but it&#8217;s a world where you need video to prove police misconduct or it didn&#8217;t happen. This is one of the reasons <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site:blog.simplejustice.us+%22but+for+video%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Greenfield&#8217;s &#8220;But for Video&#8221; series</a> is so powerful. It&#8217;s difficult for even the most open-minded to believe some of the things on these videos and even more difficult to fathom why. Sometimes police officers do misbehave, but trying to prove misconduct without really compelling evidence is often a losing proposition.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I think the above is a little too pessimistic. Yes, you want to go into trial with your eyes open, but sometimes the trial gods smile on you. In this case, we didn&#8217;t get a total win, but we were able to get a not guilty verdict on a felony charge that would have otherwise led to a consecutive prison sentence. The client was actually happy about it &#8211; he is now eligible for a probation sentence instead.</p>

<p>A chemist at the DEA Mid-Atlantic Laboratory wrote in a report that three samples suspected to be marijuana turned purple in a <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/the-myth-of-specific-identification-of-marijuana-in-criminal-court-part-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duquenois-Levine color test.</a> The problem is that the picture of the test (not included in the report but in the analyst&#8217;s case-file) showed only one sample that might conceivably indicate the sample was marijuana (and even that one is weak).<span id="more-463"></span></p>
<p>Is there any reason for the analyst to photograph the color test against a green background other than to obscure the real colors obtained? Compare the picture above against an example of what the D-L color test should look like (copied from <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin McShane</a>&#8216;s site for purposes of illustration and comment):</p>
<p><figure style="width: 312px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/modified-Duquenois-Levine.png?resize=312%2C404" width="312" height="404"  data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This is what a Duquenois-Levine color test of marijuana should look like. The top is purple and the bottom is pink.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #444444; line-height: 1.7;">The truth is that color tests like these are not specific for marijuana, meaning that the test may show a color even if the sample is not marijuana &#8211; there&#8217;s a huge list of plants and chemicals that could cause a purple or purple-ish color. But if there is no color at all, the chemists tell us in their testimony that this would indicate that the sample is not marijuana. So by that token, the lack of color in the test would be evidence that the sample is not marijuana. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #444444; line-height: 1.7;">You can only get this evidence by requesting the information from the government and cross-examining their expert.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though everyone in the DC government, from the DC Council to the prosecutors at the Office of the Attorney General, knows that alcohol in the urine has a &#8220;loose correlation&#8221; to intoxication, that urinalysis is unreliable, people are still regularly prosecuted and convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) base on their urine scores.</p>
<p>Back in June of 2011, DC Chief Toxicologist Lucas Zarwell of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, stated under oath to the DC Council that urine testing cannot reliably determine impairment or blood alcohol levels. In response to a question from council member Phil Mendelson, Mr. Zarwell testified as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>MENDELSON. How accurate is urine testing for measuring blood alcohol content?</p>
<p>ZARWELL. It&#8217;s not.</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FUmhJ_jPF1E" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><span id="more-446"></span>Upon council member Mendelson’s questioning, Mr. Zarwell further explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>MENDELSON. If a urine sample is taken from me and there&#8217;s a high concentration of alcohol in it . . . doesn&#8217;t that suggest that I&#8217;m intoxicated?</p>
<p>ZARWELL. It can. That depends on the officer&#8217;s observations. It can help, I believe, be associated with that. But if you&#8217;re going to look at urine concentrations of alcohol and science, there&#8217;s a very loose correlation. There have been several studies on it. But currently, if you&#8217;re just voiding your urine or urinating into a cup, that does not correlate to a blood concentration. It could be much higher, as much as 40% higher.</p>
<p>MENDELSON. What’s the “it” there? What could be higher?</p>
<p>ZARWELL. The urine concentration could be higher than your blood alcohol concentration, it could be lower than your blood alcohol concentration. . . .</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an old way of doing things. . . . It&#8217;s better to have an officer&#8217;s observations to be able to say, yes, we&#8217;ve got alcohol present. . . .</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s no doubt from a scientific standpoint that blood and breath are a better indicator of, the best indicator to see what kind of effect alcohol is having on the brain. Because the blood is circulating the brain and that&#8217;s where the drug is having its effect and that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re seeing levels of impairment. And this has been studied heavily in the community.</p></blockquote>
<div>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested, you should watch the video. While there was a time that the government prosecutors did not attempt to introduce urine scores, I believe primarily because of confrontation and scheduling issues, that time seems to be over.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s unconscionable that the government is using these urine-alcohol scores in <em>per se </em>DUI prosecutions knowing that they are unreliable. Even worse, DC judges have been denying motions to exclude these scores as unreliable by saying that the DC Council is presumed to have considered the evidence in passing the <em>per se</em> DUI laws (a presumption that is demonstrably false). All we as defense attorneys can do is continue to file these motions in the hope that one day we will be successful. And I continue to aggressively fight this fight for my clients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was consulted on a case the other day where a person had pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession (of something that&#8217;s not marijuana) over his lawyer&#8217;s warnings that it make him removable. The judge also (post-Padilla) made sure that the person knew that there could be immigration consequences. But all the person could hear was that the prosecutor would be asking for probation if he accepted the plea deal (which was also the likely sentence even after trial).</p>
<p>So you can guess what happened. After an ill-advised trip abroad, the person received a Notice to Appear in immigration court. As a legal permanent resident with medical issues, he was eligible for cancellation of removal (which he ended up getting, with a sympathetic judge). But it could easily have gone the other way. Cancellation is a discretionary remedy, which means that the judge could have denied it if he had a good reason to do so.<span id="more-429"></span></p>
<p>I would recommend that a legal permanent resident or anyone else who is not a citizen do <a title="In Drug Cases, Cross-Examine that “Expert”!" href="http://new.theclementsfirm.com/in-drug-cases-cross-examine-that-expert/">everything</a> <a title="Why It’s Important To Get Drug Lab Info In Drug Cases" href="http://new.theclementsfirm.com/why-its-important-to-get-drug-lab-info-in-drug-cases/">possible</a> to <a title="If a Misdemeanor Could Lead to Removal of a Non-Citizen, the Charge *Might Be* Jury-Demandable In DC" href="http://new.theclementsfirm.com/if-a-misdemeanor-could-lead-to-removal-of-a-non-citizen-the-charge-might-be-jury-demandable-in-dc/">fight</a> getting a controlled substance conviction, which makes a person removable under the immigration laws  (and in most cases, I recommend that citizens also fight). When you plead guilty you have a 100% chance of conviction. Unless you are getting a significant benefit (having the government drop other charges, etc), it rarely makes sense to plead guilty to a misdemeanor possession charge. There may be grounds for a motion to surpress the arrest and evidence and you never know, the government witnesses may fail to show for trial.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike every other drug you can (illegally) possess in the District, the D.C. Council has made possession of any amount of liquid PCP a felony punishable by up to 3 years and/or $3000 fine.* In part, this was because the D.C. Council felt that PCP is a more dangerous drug than other so-called &#8220;hard drugs,&#8221; in that the Council believes that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although a person might commit a crime related to heroin or cocaine (usually a robbery to obtain the money to purchase the heroin or cocaine), individuals often commit crimes <em>because</em> they are on PCP. PCP give users the feeling of strength and invulnerability.</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, the D.C. Council has collectively forgotten the &#8217;80&#8217;s and the heyday of powder cocaine. Anyway, the D.C. Council then goes on to list several bizarre crimes committed on PCP as testified to by Patricia Riley, special council to the U.S. Attorney for D.C. Ms. Riley testified that:</p>
<blockquote><p>A friend I talked to about this testimony this morning remembered a case where a man stabbed his girlfriend 57 times. I remember a case where a woman put her baby in the microwave and turned it on.</p></blockquote>
<p>There was no support or testimony about any actions Ms. Riley may have taken to verify that these acts actually occurred. Unsupported urban legends don&#8217;t belong in sworn testimony to the D.C. Council.<span id="more-397"></span></p>
<p>While there have been a <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20064806-504083.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">couple</a> of <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/06/21/calif-mom-arrested-after-baby-dies-in-microwave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cases</a> where a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/daily/sept99/microwave.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">woman</a> microwaved a baby, and a <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6017940" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">few</a> <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,303736,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more</a> where a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/27/usa.internationalcrime1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">man</a> was <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/father-puts-baby-microwave-says-he-was-drunk-and-high" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">involved</a>, none had any link to PCP (although <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/father-puts-baby-microwave-says-he-was-drunk-and-high" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one case</a> where a man put his baby in the microwave after smoking pot all day and splitting a fifth of whiskey with his girlfriend claimed that the marijuana may have been laced with PCP or another hallucinogen). I could find absolutely no news articles about a man stabbing her girlfriend 57 times while high on PCP &#8211; one would expect this to make the news, no? But why let truth get in the way of a good story?</p>
<p>Ms. Riley also listed case studies of crimes involving PCP, which presumably were more fact based (I am not going to check each one), but that does not excuse the fact that she felt the need to testify to the above unsupported horror stories to get the Council to pass this draconian law.</p>
<p>Anyway, I certainly don&#8217;t support PCP or other drug use, but I don&#8217;t judge it either (unless you&#8217;re one of my children, in which case, Bad Kiddie!). But the fact is, no drug compares to alcohol when considering involvement in violent crime. <a href="http://www.ncadd.org/index.php/learn-about-alcohol/alcohol-and-crime">The National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence</a> reports, based on a review of DOJ statistics, that alcohol is involved in 40% of all violent crime in the U.S. But we ignore the link between alcohol and crime because we tried that unsuccessfully in Prohibition.</p>
<p>The real reason for the extra-harsh penalties for possession of liquid PCP is that the D.C. Council believes that liquid PCP is more consistent with distribution than use, but doesn&#8217;t want to make prosecutors have to prove it.  Notwithstanding its recounting of the horrors committed by PCP users, the D.C. Council says that its action &#8220;should not be considered as a bill to punish users.&#8221; The Council stated its belief that &#8220;sellers typically carry liquid, [but] users typically carry one or two dippers.&#8221; This shows that the D.C. Council intended to incorporate an unrebuttable presumption that a person possessing liquid PCP intended to distribute, a presumption that results in unconstitutional burden shifting to defendants.</p>
<p>* These are maximum penalties, not the likely penalties; as a felony, sentencing would most likely follow the <a href="http://acs.dc.gov/acs/frames.asp?doc=/acs/lib/acs/pdf/2013_Voluntary_Sentencing_Guidelines_Manual.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sentencing guidelines</a>, which would recommend 6-18 months (some or all of which could be suspended) for conviction for possession of liquid PCP for a person with very little criminal history. By contrast, simple possession of other drugs, including PCP in any other form (powder, dipper, etc.) is a misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of 180 days (also not the likely sentence in many cases).</p>
