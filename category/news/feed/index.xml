<p>So Noah asked that I put the title first so we can search them and no longer title my blogs as Beach Walk with the number. Has he met me? I count everything.  So today was beach walk # 11 for those of you who know me and know I am keeping count, but for Noah the title is My Story.</p>



<p>Like all businesses, at some point a website is created and bios are written and today I wrote mine.  It was really hard, honestly I have put off doing it for months. How do I want to tell my story? What is important to me about me? What do I think others would find useful to know? What experiences may speak to some?  How much detail should I give?</p>



<p>I began to look at bios online, not because I’m creepy but for inspiration. As I noticed the bios I found interesting, meaning the bios where I read the whole bio were the ones that had the “why” included.  I could care less where you went to school, but it is interesting to me why you chose that school which is a question I have asked many over the last 3 years while my children have been going through the college decision process.  It is more interesting to me why people leave a particular job than how they got the job in the first place. Why they live where they live is more interesting than where they live to me.</p>



<p>So I went to Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, VA because I didn’t get into the University of Virginia (my dad had gone to the Darden school and I was awed).  It ended up being a great fit for me so I stayed. I left Goldman Sachs because after 4 months of paid maternity leave and no perspective other than hiring a nanny and going back to 60 hour work weeks I realized I wanted to see my daughter’s smiles not pay someone else to.  I live in Coral Gables, FL because our 16 year old daughter Elise suggested it. We can walk to see our niece and nephew and walk to work. After commuting on the DC beltway for the last 3 years I try to go in the car as little as possible, so this works well for me.</p>



<p>Yes, I wrote <a href="/about/caroline-clements/">my bio</a>.  It’s on <a href="/about/caroline-clements/">the bio page.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today in Baltimore Immigration Court, I was lucky to be able to help a client from Eritrea get asylum.  My client had been subjected to almost six months incommunicado detention where she was raped and beaten after speaking out against the government at a work meeting.  Like many Eritrean women, she had also been subjected to female genital mutilation (cutting/circumcision) that continues to cause her much pain.  She was granted asylum on two grounds: membership in the particular social group of Tegrigna women opposed to FGM, and on account of imputed political opinion.  I am very grateful to have been a part of helping this client get asylum protection from removal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In another example of reality undercutting the hysterical claims by anti-immigration proponents that border failures and a flood of new illegal immigrants require discriminatory state laws to &#8220;fill in the gap,&#8221;  the <a href="http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/mexican-migration-patterns-signal-new-immigration-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Immigration Policy Center reports</a> that immigration from Mexico (the largest source of immigration) has <strong><em>decreased</em> <em>by 60%</em></strong> since 2006!  But this does not mean that the Administration&#8217;s &#8220;enforcement-only&#8221; approach is working.  <span id="more-143"></span>Indeed,  as the Immigration Policy Center states:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reports also reveal that, despite years of <a href="http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/default/files/docs/Enforcement_During_Recession_090910_0.pdf">increased spending</a> on immigration enforcement, including <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/enforcement-ar-2010.pdf">record-setting</a> numbers of deportations under the Obama Administration—and despite the impact of a recession and persistently stagnant labor market in the United States—<em>fewer</em> Mexican immigrants are leaving the country now than in years past.  Moreover, the Mexican American population continues to increase, and Mexican immigrants in the United States have become the parents of a new generation of Mexican Americans.  In other words, Mexican immigrants are staying and they are becoming more and more integrated into U.S. society.</p></blockquote>
<p>Contrary to statements by anti-immigrant groups, there is no &#8220;<a href="http://www.fairus.org/site/PageNavigator/site/PageNavigator/facts/immigration_101.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unprecedented rise</a> in the number of immigrants admitted to this country every year&#8221;.  Rather <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/ois_ill_pe_2010.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three-fifths</a> of unauthorized immigrants have been here more than ten years and many are having children.  What this means is that harsher enforcement methods and new state anti-immigrant laws will disproportionately serve to break up families, harming US citizen children, and disrupt communities, without much effect on incoming immigration, which has already drastically dropped.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Please, no one take this as an excuse to blow off the Board of Immigration Appeals deadlines, but the 9th Circuit recently restated its holding that the BIA&#8217;s appeals deadline is not jurisdictional, overturning (in that circuit) the BIA&#8217;s attempted overruling of circuit precedent.  In a decision found <a href="http://www.metnews.com/sos.cgi?0611%2F07-71806" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, the 9th Circuit called the 30-day deadline a &#8220;claim-processing rule&#8221; rather than a limit on jurisdiction.</p>
<p><span id="more-124"></span></p>
<p>The court noted that in its previous case, <em><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17492048931404309740&amp;q=Oh+v.+Gonzales&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oh v. Gonzales</a></em>, it had held that the BIA&#8217;s position that it had no authority to accept a late filing was incorrect as a matter of law &#8220;because the BIA, despite its  &#8216;jurisdictional&#8217; argument, claimed authority to excuse late filings in  &#8216;rare circumstances.&#8217;  The Second Circuit had made a similar holding in <em><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5489537184331094306&amp;q=Zhong+Guang+Sun+v.+U.S.+Department+of+Justice.&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zhong Guang Sun v. U.S. Department of Justice</a></em>.</p>
<p>After reviewing a number of Supreme Court decisions where court filing deadlines were treated as non-jurisdictional, the 9th Circuit noted that the BIA itself treated its appeals deadline as non-jurisdictional when it suited:</p>
<blockquote><p>Congress did not set the thirty-day time limit before us. It delegated to the agency the power to issue regulations with respect to the time period for filing. And the regulation does not say that it is jurisdictional. Nor does the agency itself treat the time limit as jurisdictional. Instead, the agency sua sponte decides to exercise its authority where the reasons for lateness are  “extraordinary,” something it could not do if the time limit was jurisdictional. By reviewing cases where the lateness is extraordinary, the agency interprets its own regulation as a non-jurisdictional claim-processing rule.</p></blockquote>
<p>The court went further and suggested that the Board should adopt e-filing, implying that by not adopting e-filing, the Board may be acting arbitrarily in applying its deadline, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The BIA argues that the alien should “file as far in advanceof the deadline as possible.” That answer is unsatisfactory because a person with fundamental interests at stake is entitled to certainty about when he must ask to be heard in order to get a hearing.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Just as we have for many decades assumed the availability of telephones, automobiles, and airplanes, we ought now toassume the availability of email and the internet when we assess the reasonableness of government action.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an important decision &#8211; it will be interesting to see whether other circuits follow suit and how the BIA reacts.</p>
