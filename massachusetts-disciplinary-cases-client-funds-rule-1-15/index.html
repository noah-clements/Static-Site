The respondent’s accounting records concerning his maintenance of the checking accounts for
each trust were uniformly inadequate to document his receipt, maintenance and disbursementof the funds of each trust. He did not maintain check registers that included information onthe purpose of disbursements or a running balance after each entry. He also did not maintainand preserve adequate records supporting payments he made to himself for purported feesearned and expenses incurred on behalf of the trusts. The respondent’s failure to maintainadequate records concerning his receipt, maintenance and disbursement of trust funds was inviolation of Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.1, 1.2(a), 1.3 and <strong>1.15</strong>(a) for conduct prior to July 1, 2004 and1.15(f) for conduct on and after that date.
Each trust required the respondent to provide its beneficiary with annual accountings of the</p>
<p>At page 1 trust’s funds. The respondent did not provide any beneficiary with any annual accounting until 2004, when he provided one beneficiary with summary and incomplete accountings for 1996 through 2003. After repeatedly promising a lawyer for another beneficiary that he would provide accountings, he only provided that beneficiary with summary and incomplete accountings in 2005. The respondent’s failure to render annual accountings of his administration of the trusts was in violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.1, 1.2(a), 1.3 and <strong>1.15</strong>(b)for conduct prior to July 1, 2004 and 15(d)(1) for conduct on and after that date.
As trustee, the respondent was responsible for filing required state and federal income tax</p>

After the respondent began representing the mother in the divorce, he transferred the trust’s
funds to a joint checking account on which both he and the mother were signatories, and bothhe and the mother disbursed trust funds from the account. This was in violation of Mass. R.Prof. C. 1.1, 1.2(a), 1.7(a), 1.7(b) and 1.15(a) for conduct prior to July 1, 2004 and <strong>1.15</strong>(b)for conduct on and after that date. The respondent also made substantial payments of trustfunds for the mother’s attorneys’ fees, including his own, in violation of the terms of thetrust. While the respondent made these payments with the understanding that the motherwould repay the trust if and when the marital home was sold, this loan arrangement wasundocumented and unsecured. This conduct was in violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.1, 1.2(a),1.7(a) and 1.7(b).
Finally, on three occasions in 2001 and 2003, the respondent advanced funds from trusts,</p>
<p>At page 2 including two not otherwise involved in this matter, to cover debts or expenses of another trust. The respondent caused these advances to be repaid from the appropriate trust within weeks or months of the advance. These transfers were not authorized by any of the trust documents involved, and the respondent did not pay any interest when he caused the advances to be returned. The respondent’s misuse of trust funds for unrelated payments was in violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.1, 1.2(a), 1.7(a), 1.7(b), 1.15(a) (for conduct prior to July 1,2004; now <strong>1.15</strong>(b)), 8.4(c) and 8.4(h). To the extent that the respondent advanced the funds as loans, his engaging in unauthorized loans and his failure to document the loans or pay interest were in violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.1, 1.2(a), 1.7(a) and 1.7(b).
In aggravation, the respondent failed to file a timely answer to the Petition For Discipline.</p>

This matter came to Bar Counsel’s attention pursuant to Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>(f) as a result of
receipt of a notice of dishonored check from the bank at which the respondent maintains hisIOLTA account.</p>
<p>At page 1<br>
personal or business purposes with intent to deprive clients or third parties of the funds atleast temporarily and with actual deprivation resulting.
The respondent’s conduct was in violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>(a), (b) and 8.4(c) and (h).The respondent was under extreme financial stress as a result of acute family problems. He
voluntarily ceased the practice of law with notice to all clients and provision for substitutecounsel and an orderly transition of files prior to February 13, 2001, the date on which he wasadministratively suspended for non-payment of his annual registration fee.</p>

The respondent commingled client and personal funds, failed to account for the retainers, and
converted the unearned portion of the retainers to his own use, in violation of Mass. R. Prof.C. <strong>1.15</strong>(a) and (b), as in effect prior to July 1, 2004, (lawyer shall hold property of clientsseparate from the lawyer’s own property, maintain complete records of the receipt,maintenance, and disposition of such funds, promptly deliver to the client his funds, and shallpromptly render and full accounting of such funds) and Mass. R. Prof. C. 8.4 (c) and (h)(conduct involving dishonestly, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation and conduct adverselyreflecting on his fitness to practice law). The respondent’s failure to return the unearnedportion of the retainers was also in violation of the order of administrative suspension andS.J.C. Rule 4:01, § 17, and therefore violated Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.4(c) (lawyer shall notknowingly disobey an obligation under the rule of a tribunal) and Mass. R. Prof. C. 8.4 (d) and(h) (conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice). Finally, the respondent’s failurewithout good cause to respond to bar counsel’s requests for information was in violation ofS.J.C. Rule 4:01, § 17, and therefore violated Mass. R. Prof. C. 8.1(b) (lawyer shall notknowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from bar counsel) and Mass. R.Prof. C. 8.4(d) and (g) (lawyer shall not fail without good cause to cooperate with barcounsel).

2. IOLTA accounts. Rule <strong>1.15</strong> of the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct governs the safekeeping
of property entrusted to an attorney . An attorney in possession of &quot;trust property ,&quot; defined as the &quot;property</p>
<p>At page 4<br>
more than nominal and is to be held for longer than a short period of time, an attorney must deposit the
money into an individual trust account. Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>(e)(6). With an individual trust account, the
identity of the beneficial owner should always be known because the account is held in a client&#8217;s name, with</p>
<p>At page 4 ll accruing interest paid to the client. Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>(e)(3), (6). But an IOL TA account is a &quot;pooled
account&quot; that may hold deposits from multiple clients and third persons at the same time. Mass. R. Prof. C.</p>

responsible to &quot;promptly deliver to the client or third person any funds or other property that the client or
third person is entitled to receive,&quot; Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>(c), an attorney is required to adhere to strict
record-keeping and reconciliation requirements for an IOL TA account. See Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.15(f). An</p>

Where an attorney fails to keep careful records and prepare periodic reconciliation reports, the risk arises</p>
<p>At page 4<br>
keeping, financial institutions accepting IOL TA deposits must agree to report any dishonored checks on
IOLTA accounts to the board. Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>(h)(1). Because a dishonored check in an IOL TA
account may reflect an attorney&#8217;s failure properly to manage an IOL TA account, receipt of such notice may</p>

<p>At page 1<br>
Background. Bar counsel filed with the Board of Bar Overseers (board) a petition for discipline
alleging that Osagiede had intentionally misused a client&#8217;s funds, intentionally deprived theclient of the funds, and misrepresented the status of settlement to the client; negligentlymisused other clients&#8217; funds and deprived the clients of the funds; commingled personal,business, and client funds; failed to pursue his clients&#8217; goals and to keep them informed;failed to keep required records for several accounts holding trust funds; and failed to renderaccountings. A hearing committee found in substance that bar counsel had proved thepetition&#8217;s allegations, and that Osagiede violated a number of the Massachusetts Rules ofProfessional Conduct, including Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.2 (a), 426 Mass. 1310 (1998); Mass. R. Prof.C. 1.4, 426 Mass. 1314 (1998); Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.5 (c), as amended, 432 Mass. 1301 (2000);Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong> (a), (b), (c), (d), and (f), 426 Mass. 1363 (1998); and Mass. R. Prof. C.8.4 (c) and (h), 426 Mass. 1429 (1998). The committee recommended that Osagiede beindefinitely suspended and that his reinstatement be conditioned on his attending, in the yearpreceding his petition for reinstatement, a continuing legal education course, of bar counsel&#8217;schoosing, in trust accounting. The board agreed. The board filed an information that washeard by a single justice, who issued an order of indefinite suspension.
The petition for discipline filed by bar counsel contained five counts. Three of those counts</p>

The sanction for similar cumulative misconduct in previous cases has varied, depending on the
severity of the misconduct. In Matter of Jackman, 444 Mass. 1013, 1014 (2004), this courtstated that &quot;with respect to the misconduct involving fee splitting, inadequate supervision ofnonlawyers, and assisting in the unauthorized practice of law, a term suspension iswarranted.&quot; See Matter of Luongo, 416 Mass. 308, 311 (1993) (&quot;standing alone, the attorney&#8217;sknowing participation in the practice of law with [a nonlawyer] warrants at least a suspensionfrom the practice of law, where the attorney obtained financial gain from the association andclients were defrauded&quot;). Jackman was suspended for two years for his improper associationwith nonlawyers and negligent misuse of client funds, each of which caused harm to clientsand warranted a term suspension. Matter of Jackman, supra at 1014-<strong>1015</strong>. As noted by boththe respondent and bar counsel, the misuse of client funds as a result of Jackman&#8217;s inaction isa significant difference between Jackman and the respondent&#8217;s case. See Matter of Wysocki,16 Mass. Att&#8217;y Discipline Rep. 437 (2000) (two-year suspension for assisting disbarred lawyer&#8217;spractice [without fee split or financial benefit], taking cases from disbarred lawyer withoutconsent, neglect, commingling, and record-keeping violations); Matter of DiCicco, 6 Mass.Att&#8217;y Discipline Rep. 83, 89 (1989) (two-year suspension for assisting in unauthorized practiceof law by paralegal, including representing that paralegal was &quot;of counsel,&quot; neglect of cases,and other misconduct). Conversely, the respondent&#8217;s infractions were less egregious,particularly in light of his belief, albeit misguided, that all of Porter&#8217;s actions were sanctionedby the MCAD. Accordingly, we conclude that a suspension of less than two years isappropriate, as the cases imposing a two-year suspension involve conduct more severe thanthe respondent&#8217;s actions in this case.
The respondent relies on cases where the sanction for similar misconduct was less than one</p>

Prof. C. 1.7(b) by representing Glynn in the closing when hisrepresentation was materially limited by responsibilities to other clients, to third parties,and by his own interests, all without obtaining the consent of each client afterconsultation. In support of this ruling, the committee noted that he had threatened, inderogation of his duties as counsel to Glynn, to withhold distribution of the proceeds ofthe condominium closing in order to secure payment of the Alliance loan.
The hearing committee rejected bar counsel’s contentions that the respondent had alsoviolated Mass. R. Prof. C. 8.4(b), which prohibits criminal conduct that reflects on a lawyer’shonesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer, as well as charges that he violated Mass. R.Prof. C. 8.4(c), which prohibits conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, ormisrepresentation. The committee viewed respondent’s conduct – failing to make theappropriate filing with the Attorney General – as flowing from a negligent error of law, notfrom any dishonesty, deceit, or untrustworthiness. Finally, the committee rejected a chargethat he had interfered with the “prompt[] deliver[y]” of client funds in violation of Mass. R.Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong> by threatening to withhold the proceeds from the condominium sale until theloan was paid because, the committee found, the funds were delivered promptly once theclosing proceeds were ripe for disbursement.

Based on the copies of bank records and cancelled checks produced by bar counsel, I conclude
that bar counsel has satisfied her burden of showing by a preponderance of evidence thatrespondent has violated a disciplinary rule. On the most fundamental level, the respondenthas violated Massachusetts Rule of Professional Conduct 1.5 (c) (contingency fee agreementsmust be in writing and state, among other items, the nature of the claim or controversy, theservices to be performed, and the contingency upon which compensation is to be paid).Moreover, the evidence shows at least by a preponderance of the evidence that therespondent&#8217;s actions violated rules 1.15(a) (lawyer shall not collect a clearly excessive fee);1.15(b) (lawyer shall safeguard and keep separate client funds); 1.15(c) (lawyer shouldpromptly notify client upon receiving client funds); <strong>1.15</strong>(d) (lawyer shall render fullaccounting of trust property upon request by the client); and 8.4(c) (lawyer shall not engagein conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentations). These violationsamount to a likely intentional misappropriation of client funds that resulted in actualdeprivation to the client, Hoffmann. The presumptive sanction for such conduct is disbarmentor indefinite suspension. Matter of Schoepfer , 426 Mass. 183, 187(1997).

Bar counsel filed a two-count petition for discipline with the Board of Bar Overseers (board),
alleging that the respondent violated various disciplinary rules arising out of his representationof two clients. The allegations were deemed admitted, pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 4:01, § 8 (3),as amended, 430 Mass. 1314 (1999), and have not been challenged on appeal. In summary, therespondent deposited two checks issued by insurance companies for the benefit of his clientsinto his business checking account, rather than into either an IOLTA or designated trustaccount. He thereby commingled funds in violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.15 (a), (d), and (e),426 Mass. 1363 (1998). The respondent then used a portion of his clients&#8217; funds to pay his ownpersonal and business expenses, &quot;with the intent to deprive [his client] of the funds at leasttemporarily and with actual deprivation resulting,&quot; in violation of Mass.

This matter came before me on an information and record of proceedings, together with a

Rule 4:01, § 8 (3), secondpar, as appearing in 435 Mass 1302 (2002). Bar counsel asserted that the respondent violatedMass. R. Prof. C 1.15 (f)(l)(B), Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.15(f )(1)(C), Mass. R.

Counts Two and Three of the petition for discipline involved financial record keeping problems
in the respondent&#8217;s trust account, including commingling cash payments from clients withpersonal cash and failing otherwise to maintain adequate or complete records. Count Twoarose from a complaint by clients whose funds (mortgage payments) the respondent washolding in trust as part of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan. The plan was dismissed for unrelatedreasons before the payments were remitted to the mortgagee. The respondent thereafter paidthe clients the funds that he was holding on their behalf in his trust account. However,because the respondent had commingled certain cash payments from the clients with his ownfunds, he did not show the receipt of the cash on his client ledger and inadvertentlymiscalculated the balance that the clients were due. After the complaint to Bar Counsel wasfiled, the respondent found the discrepancy and reimbursed the clients for the $870 shortfallcaused by his inaccurate accounting. The respondent&#8217;s conduct in this matter was in violationof Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>(a),(b) and its predecessor DR 9-102(A),(B)(3),(4).
Count Three arose from two notices of dishonored checks sent to Bar Counsel by the bank in</p>
<p>At page 1 hich the respondent maintained his IOLTA account. The first check was dishonored becausethe respondent had by mistake failed to make a deposit. In the second instance, severalchecks were dishonored because the respondent mistakenly paid himself, as fees, sumsreceived from clients intended to cover both fees and costs. The respondent then paid thecosts from the trust account despite the fact that the monies needed to support thesedisbursements had already been withdrawn. The dishonored checks were paid upon redepositor replaced. The respondent&#8217;s conduct in this matter was again in violation of Mass. R. Prof.C. <strong>1.15</strong>(a),(b) and its predecessor DR 9-102(A),(B)(3),(4).

engaged the respondent to collect moneys due on a note. After declaring retired status onNovember 10, 2006, the respondent referred the matter to another attorney, who eventuallysettled the case.

The hearing committee concluded that misuse resulting in actual deprivation occurred
because the Higginbottoms&#8217; funds were the only funds in the IOLTA account and the account balance consistently fell below the amount needed to pay off the mortgage as a result of the numerous cash withdrawals that the respondent made. In addition, the funds were due immediately to the mortgagee on the Higginbottoms&#8217; behalf, but the respondent failed to timely pay off the mortgage. Eventually, the Higginbottoms were forced to pay off the mortgage using additional personal funds. The record therefore adequately supports the hearing committee&#8217;s conclusion, which the board adopted, that misuse resulting in deprivation occurred in violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong> (b) and 8.4 (c), (h).

Paul J. Grella is before the court on an Information filed by the Board of Bar Overseers
(board) recommending that he be disbarred. The recommended sanction is for violations ofMass. R. Prof. C. 1.2(a), 1.3, 1.4(a), 1.15(a), <strong>1.15</strong>(b), 8.1(b), 8.4(c), 8.4(d), 8.4(g), and8.4(h). I held a hearing on July 27, 2006, and have carefully reviewed the record ofproceedings before the board, including the special hearing officer&#8217;s report, which the boardadopted. I conclude that disbarment is the appropriate sanction (an issue not disputed byGrella), and reject the respondent&#8217;s claim that the disbarment should be retroactive to thedate he was eligible to be reinstated following an earlier suspension on an unrelated matter.</p>

liquidation, Bailey was then to transmit the proceeds to the United States. Bailey sold the
Japanese stock and deposited approximately $730,000 into his Credit Suisse account on orabout July 6, 1994. Bailey then transferred the money into his Barnett Bank Money MarketAccount. The money was paid to the United States Marshal on or about August 15, 1994. Thereferee found that Bailey admitted that his money market account was not a lawyer&#8217;s trustaccount, nor did Bailey create or maintain it as a separate account for the sole purpose ofmaintaining the stock proceeds. In concluding that Bailey had engaged in commingling, thereferee rejected Bailey&#8217;s claims that there were no personal funds in the Barnett Bank accountat the time Bailey transferred the funds from the Japanese Stock into this account, and thatBailey&#8217;s deposit of the proceeds into a non-trust account was “inadvertent error.” The refereeconcluded that Bailey violated Rule Regulating the Florida Bar 4-<strong>1.15</strong>(a) by failing to set up aseparate account for these funds and also by commingling client funds with his personal funds.
Count II of the Bar&#8217;s complaint charged Bailey with misappropriating trust funds and</p>
<p>At page 3<br>
The referee rejected Bailey&#8217;s two defenses to the Bar&#8217;s charge of misappropriation: (1) he
never held the stock in trust for Duboc or the United States; rather, it was transferred to himin fee simple absolute; and (2) this stock was not subject to forfeiture. The referee foundBailey guilty of violating Rules Regulating the Florida Bar 3-4.3 (lawyer shall not commit anyact that is contrary to honesty and justice), 4-<strong>1.15</strong>(a) (commingling funds), 4-8.4(b) (lawyershall not commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer&#8217;s honesty,trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer), 4-8.4(c) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involvingdeceit, dishonesty, fraud or misrepresentation), and 5-1.1 (requiring money or other propertyentrusted to an attorney to be held in trust and applied only for a specific purpose).
Count III charged Bailey with continuing to expend Biochem funds in contravention of two</p>
<p>At page 6<br>
standard of ethical and professional conduct prescribed by this Court, and with notice of rule
3-4.1. Rule 4-<strong>1.15</strong> provides:</p>
<p>At page 7<br>
If Bailey&#8217;s fee had been earned, then it could have and should have been withdrawn from a
trust account; the failure to do so would have been a violation of trust account rules. SeeFlorida Bar v. Tillman, 682 So. 2d 542 (1996) (holding that rule 4-<strong>1.15</strong>(c) requires fees to bewithdrawn when they become due and the failure to do so constitutes a trust accountviolation). However, if money is given to a client to be applied to fees when they becomeearned, much like a retainer, these monies cannot be withdrawn from a trust account andspent until they are earned. See In re Sather, 3 P.3d 403, 410 (Colo. 2000) (“[U]nearnedportion[s] of . . . advance fees must be kept in trust and cannot be treated as the attorney&#8217;sproperty until earned.”). In this case, by express agreement, Bailey was not entitled to anyfees until determined and approved by Judge Paul. Thus, he was expressly prohibited fromwithdrawing and spending any portion of the stock for his own personal benefit until approvedby Judge Paul. See generally Spann, 682 So. 2d at 1070-71.
In light of the foregoing, we conclude that regardless of the manner in which the stock was</p>

45. The respondent denied this allegation in his answer, writing simply “[d]enied” at ¶ 22. We place little stock in this denial, because it violates B.B.O Rules, § 3.15(d). That rule provides that an answer shall deny “specifically, and in reasonable detail, each material allegation of the petition and state clearly and concisely the facts and matters of law relied upon.</p>
<p>At page 18<br>

account and withdrawn as earned. The respondent’s failure to do this violated Rule <strong>1.15</strong>(b)(1).

request was made and ignored. See Ex. 29 (128, 129) (undated email to bar c ounsel) (three</p>
<p>At page 18 eferences to the respondent failing to provide an accounting). We note that the text of Rule <strong>1.15</strong>(d)(1) provides for an accounting upon final distribution, with or without a request. 57. W e conclude, based on Klunder’s email to bar counsel and the respondent’s
admission, that no accounting was ever provided. Cf. Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.15(d)(2) (not charged) (setting out requirements for lawyer to follow on or before making a withdrawal of fees from a</p>

On at least two occasions in 1998 and 1999, the client demanded that the respondent provide</p>

In 2000, the client filed suit against the respondent alleging that he had converted her</p>
<p>At page 2 roperty, made misrepresentations to her, and breached his fiduciary duty to her by misusingand misappropriating her funds. Shortly thereafter, the respondent established a newcorporation, opened a new bank account in the name of the new corporation, and transferredfunds from the Cape Cod account and the Bahamian account to the new bank account in orderto conceal from the client what remained of the funds she had entrusted to him. This conductviolated Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.4(a) (lawyer shall not unlawfully obstruct another party’s accessto evidence). The respondent commingled his own personal funds with the client’s funds in thenew account and intentionally converted the client’s funds to his own use, all in violation ofMass. R.

SUMMARY2
In or about October 19, 2001, and pursuant to Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>(f), Bar Counsel received
a notice of a dishonored check, drawn on the respondent&#8217;s IOLTA account, from the bank atwhich the account was maintained. The respondent&#8217;s IOLTA account was a commingledaccount, used for the deposit and disbursement of trust funds, as well as for ATM withdrawalsfor personal use. The returned check was payable to a client and represented a share of theproceeds of a $10,000 civil settlement.</p>
<p>At page 1<br>
The respondent&#8217;s commingling of trust funds with personal or business funds, and his
intentional misappropriation of the settlement funds with intent to deprive the client or hermedical provider of the funds at least temporarily and with actual deprivation resulting,violated Mass. R. Prof. C. 8.4(c),(h) and Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.15(a),(b). The respondent&#8217;s depositto his IOLTA account of the settlement check without the knowledge, authorization, orendorsement of the co?payee is in violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. 8.4(c),(h). The respondent&#8217;sdisbursement to the client of funds owed to the HMO pursuant to its statutory medical lien isin violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>(a),(b).
On or about January 8, 2002, Bar Counsel sent the respondent notice of the dishonored check</p>

The respondent’s conduct in June 1991 of retaining $1,000 held for “future medical services”
when no future medical services were anticipated violated Canon Nine, DR 9-102(B)(4) (lawyershall promptly deliver to client funds the client is entitled to receive). His conduct in failingpromptly to turn over the entire $5,343 in April 1997, when the statute of limitations had runon any claim to enforce a lien by a medical insurer violated DR 9-102(B)(4) and, after January1, 1998, Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>(b).
The respondent’s failure to negotiate the lien and pay it within a reasonable time constituted</p>

The respondent’s failure to maintain reasonable communications with his client violatedCanon Six, DR 6-101(A)(3), and Canon Seven, DR 7-101(A)(1)-(3) for conduct before January 1,1998, and Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.1and 1.4 for conduct after January 1, 1998. The respondent’smisrepresentation to the client in September 1998 that he was in the process of negotiatingthe lien with the medical insurer violated Mass. R. Prof. C. 8.4(c) and (h). The respondent’sfailure to deposit the money held for the medical insurer’s lien, $5,343, in an interest bearingaccount between April, 1991 and March, 2000 constituted a failure to deposit funds other thannominal amounts or held for a short period in an interest bearing account in violation ofCanon Six, DR 6-101(A)(3), Canon Seven, 7-101(A)(3), and Canon Nine, DR 9-102(C) forconduct prior to January 1, 1998, and Mass.

14 Although bar counsel had
alleged the violations of Rule <strong>1.15</strong>(b) and Rule 1.5(a) as alternative theories, the hearing committee determined that the theories were “not mutually exclusive.” (H R, ¶ 225).
The final count of the Petition, Count Four, arises from the respondent’s effort to</p>

charging of a clearly excessive fee violated Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.5(a) and 8.4(c) (conduct
involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation) as well as Rule <strong>1.15</strong>(b). We agree with and adopt the hearing committee’s legal conclusions in this regard.
On appeal, the respondent challenges only two of the hearing commit tee’s</p>
<p>At page 24 violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.5 and <strong>1.15</strong>. (Respondent’s Brief on Appeal, p. 40). The
argument ignores the numerous additional rules violations.</p>
<p>At page 24<br>
For starters, the respondent’s excessive fees amount to intentional misuse of client funds
with actual deprivation.17 The conduct violated Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>(b) and 8.4(c). Although
admittedly the exceptional case, the Supreme Judicial Court and the Board have held that a fee is</p>
<p>At page 25<br>
the benefit of his client or the client’s children . Because the funds were in a trust account, they
were governed by Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong> and their misuse violates that rule in addition to the
rules concerning fees and deceit.</p>
<p>At page 30<br>
and Rules 8.4(c) and (h); failing to provide his client the required notices prior to withdrawing
his fees from a trust account in violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>; and failing to maintain an
IOLTA account that complied with the accounting rules of Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.15.</p>
<p>At page 33<br>
provided something of value, even if his billing practices violate the Rules of Professional Conduct and even if the billing involves an element of dishonesty or deceit. Doing so violates both Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.5(a) (excessive or unlawful fee) as well as 8.4(c) (conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation). By contrast, intentional misuse of client or trust funds is pure theft
19 and is covered by a different rule, Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>(b). Nothing of</p>
<p>At page 34 value is given. Such conduct violates a separate Rule of Professional Conduct, Rule <strong>1.15</strong>(f),
which specifically arises when a lawyer fails to protect trust or client funds.</p>

49. Had it been charged, we would also have found a violation of Mass. R. Prof. C.
<strong>1.15</strong>(b)(3) , which provides: “A lawyer shall deposit into a trust account legal fees and expenses
that have been paid in advance, to be withdrawn by the lawyer only as fees are e arned or as</p>
<p>At page 19<br>
required to segregate and hold O’Brien’s advance payments in a trust account and, as sta ted, w e
conclude that his failure to do so would have violated rule <strong>1.15</strong>(b) . We also conclude that his
conduct would have violated rule 8.4(h) , based on the violation of rule 1.15(b) violation we</p>
<p>At page 27<br>
receive ongoing representation , and they included some of the work the respondent sai d was
covered by the retainer. See ¶ 70, above. See also Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>, comment 2(A): “A flat fee is a fixed fee that an att orney charges for all legal services in a particular matter, or for a
particular discrete component of legal services, whether relatively simple and of short duration, or complex and protracted.” (b) They were not classic retainers, either. See Matter of Sharif,</p>
<p>At page 42 We read this exception as requir ing compliance with Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>, which requires<br>
deposit of client s’ trust funds, including prepaid fees, into a trust account. The respondent did</p>

113. Turning to the federal regulations, “Mortgage Assistance Relief Service” is
defined at 12 C FR § <strong>1015</strong>.2 as follows:<br>
Mortgage Assistance Relief Service means any service, plan, or program, offered</p>
<p>At page 42<br>
Ex. 19, at BP 1255- 1256.<br>
114. “Mortgage Assistance Relief Service Provider” is defined at 12 CFR § <strong>1015</strong>.2 as
follows: “any person that provides, offers to provide, or arranges for others to provide, any</p>
<p>At page 43<br>
has executed a written agreement between the consumer and the consumer’s dwelling loan holder or servicer incorporating the offer of mortgage assistance relief the provider obtained from the consumer’s dwelling loan holder or servicer.<br>
116. An e xception for attorneys appears at 12 CFR § <strong>1015</strong>.7(b), as follows:<br>
(b) An attorney who is exempt pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is also exempt from § 1015.5 if the attorney: (1) Deposits any funds received from the</p>
<p>At page 43 is defined at 12 CFR § <strong>1015</strong>.2 as follows: “a separate account created by a licensed attorney for the purpose of holding client funds, which is: (1) Maintained in
compliance with all applicable state laws and regulations, including licensing regulations; and (2) Located in the state where the attorney’s office is located, or elsewhere in the United States with the consent of the consumer on whose behalf the funds are held.</p>
<p>At page 43<br>
meaning of this regulation. H e did not satisfy the exemption from the prohibition in 12 CFR §
<strong>1015</strong>.5 on collecting advance fees because he received advance fees that he did not deposit into a
trust account. ¶¶ 72, 74, 81, 85, above .</p>
<p>At page 45<br>
count two of the petition for discipline. Count three of the petition c ites rule 8.4(c) and rule
<strong>1.15</strong>(b) , as stated above . Had the respondent been charged in count two with improperly
depositing unearned fees into his operating account in violation of rules 1.15(b) and 8.4(c) , we</p>
<p>At page 45<br>
123. Under count one, in ¶¶ 4 8-53, above, we concluded that the respondent’s misuse
of O’Brien’s advance fee payments would have violated rules <strong>1.15</strong>(b) and 8.4(h) , had they been
charged . We found that deprivation resulted from the misuse because the respondent did not</p>
<p>At page 45<br>
earned upon receipt constituted commingling and misuse of clients’ funds that would have
violated rule <strong>1.15</strong>(b) , had it been charged . And we again conclude that Bar Counsel has not
proved dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or misrepresentation on the respondent’s part. He applied his fee agreements as written and as explained to his clients. Unlike count one, we conclude that the</p>
<p>At page 46<br>
client trust funds, violated 16 CFR §§ 322.5 and 322.7 and Regulation O, 12 CFR §§ 1015.5 and
<strong>1015</strong>.7. We conclude that Bar Counsel has proved that the respondent violated those regulations.<br>
125. Bar Counsel charge d that the respondent’s conduct violated 12 U.S.C. §§ 5531</p>
<p>At page 46<br>
that some of the provisions for contingent fees and advance payments were illegal, in that they violated the regulations cited by Bar Counsel, and therefore violated rules 1.5 and 8.4(h) and
would have violated rule <strong>1.15</strong>, as stated in ¶¶ 1 19-123, above. They did not involve dishonesty,
so no violation of rule 8.4(c) has been established.</p>

129. The respondent a dmitted that between 2011 and 2016, his firm did not maintain
the records required by Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong> for his client s’ funds IOLTA account. Tr. I:197

deposited, and treated as earned on receipt , some of those payments before they had been earned .</p>

reconciliation s of trust accounts. Tr. III:90 -91 (S. McArdle).  She could not recall reviewing<br>
Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>. Tr. III:95 (S. McArdle). For the following reasons, we find that
Stephanie did not keep properly reconciled trust account records.</p>
<p>At page 48<br>
testimony about what she did, and her description of a three -way reconciliation, did not conform
to rule <strong>1.15</strong>. Tr. III:79 -83, 87- 88, 139- 140 (S. McArdle). When the firm received an audit
request in 2016, the respondent told Morgan Russell to ask Ste phanie what needed to be done,</p>
<p>At page 48<br>
203-204 (S. McArdl e); Ex. 16 (response to Bar Counsel’s requests for information and
documents). Based on the foregoing, and on Russell’s testimony, cited in ¶ 134, below, that her own reconciliations did not compl y with rule <strong>1.15</strong> until 2018, we find that the respondent di d not
start to maintain properly reconciled trust accounts until 2018.</p>

learn the correct way to perform three- way reconciliations around 2018, when a nother title</p>

were not performed as often as required by Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>. Tr. I: 59 (Russell). N ot all the
reconciliations r esulted in a balanced reconciliation report. Tr. I:62, 64, 68, 70 (Russell); Ex. 16,</p>

likewise reject his excuse that corruption or loss of his firm’s computer records have prevented
him from demonstrating compliance with the recordkeeping requirements of rule <strong>1.15</strong>. See Tr.

$11,342.08. On that date, a deposit of $300,000, unrelated to BSI, was made into the account. Ex. 39 (Bar C ounsel’s spreadsheet summarizing activity in the clients’ fund
IOLTA account), at BP <strong>1615</strong>, lines 164, 165; Ex. 16, at BP 0748 (respondent’s spreadsheet summarizing activity in that account). Just after that, c heck no. 2813 to
BSI, for $3,000, was issued on October 23; check no. 2984, for $2,000, on October</p>
<p>At page 51<br>

BP <strong>1615</strong>, lines 164, 165, 173; Ex. 16, at BP 0748. The respondent would have us
find that the entire $9,000 consisted of his money even though it was on deposit in a clients’ funds account and made up nearly the entire balance in that account when the</p>

It was one of the three pay ments to BSI , totaling $9,000, that depleted all but
$2,342.08 of the $11,342.08 balance that was in the account before the $300,000 deposit. Ex. 39, at BP <strong>1615</strong>, lines 163, 165, 168, 171. Again, t he respondent would

the $300,000 deposit was made. Ex. 39, at BP <strong>1615</strong>, lines 163, 165, 168, 171. As we
have stated in ¶¶ 141 (i), 142(e), above, t he respondent would have us find that the</p>
<p>At page 54<br>
disbursements, only $1,092.08 remained of the $11,342.08 balance that was in the clients ’ fund IOLTA account before the $300,000 deposit was made on October 17,
2014. Ex. 39, at BP <strong>1615</strong>, lines 163, 171. By November 19, the $300,000 had been<br>
transferred out, and an unrelated disbursement of $1,025 had been made, leaving the</p>
<p>At page 54 ccount balance at $67.08. Ex. 39, at BP <strong>1615</strong>, line 173.
c. The respondent attribute d the funding of the $4,000 check to credits available to him</p>

than two months after the $4,000 check was written: $780 deposited on January 28,
2015 (Ex. 39, at BP <strong>1615</strong>, line 181, source unidentified) ; $800 in cash deposited on
February 17, 2015 (Ex. 39, at BP 1615, line 184) ; $500 transferred from a private</p>
<p>At page 55 hecking account on March 5, 2015 (Ex. 39, at BP <strong>1615</strong>, line 187) ; $1,300 deposited
on March 10, 2015 (Ex. 39, at BP 1615, line 189) ; and a $100 transfer from the</p>
<p>At page 55 espondent’s operating account (Ex. 39, at BP <strong>1615</strong>, line 191) .<br>
f. Less than two weeks after the last of th ose deposit s, the account balance was only</p>
<p>At page 55 97.08. Ex. 39, at BP <strong>1615</strong>, line 192. T herefore, before those deposits were made,
the respondent di d not have sufficient funds in the clients ’ fund IOLTA account to</p>

date. Ex. 31, at BP 1422. Another $1,800, deposited in 2013, was insufficient to cover any of the BSI checks ; that $1,800 had been depleted by November 2014, when
the account balance fell to $67.08. Ex. 39, at BP 1611, line 44 and BP <strong>1615</strong>, line 173. There is no evidence that this money, presumptively client s’ funds because deposited

respondent violated Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>(b)(1) (trust funds to be kept in trust account) . Bar
Counsel did not prove this charge as to the retainer checks alleged under this count . ¶ 1 49-150,</p>
<p>At page 69<br>
162. Bar Counsel charge d that b y failing to keep earned fees separate from client s’
funds held in a trust account, the respondent violated Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>(b)(2) (commingling
personal funds in trust account prohibited) . The respondent testi fied that he kept earned fees in</p>
<p>At page 70 the respondent violated Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>(b)(3) (fees and expenses paid in advance to be
deposited into trust account and withdrawn only as earned) . We conclude that Bar Counsel has</p>
<p>At page 70<br>
trust property, and by failing to preserve those records for at least six years, the respondent
violated Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>(f) (required records, retention for six years after conclusion of
representation or distribution of funds) . We conclude that the respondent violated that rule by</p>
<p>At page 70<br>
balances in his clients’ fund IOLTA account, and in individual clients’ accounts, the respondent
violated Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>(f)(1)(C). That rule requires maintenance of individual client records and prohibits disbursements that would create a negative balance for any individual client. The respondent admitted infrequent, unintentional negative balances that he claims were cured promptly upon discovery. We conclude that the respondent violated the rule based on our findings that he misused trust funds (¶¶ 146, 151 ( a), (b), 1 55, above ); that negative balances
occurred in two clients’ accounts (¶ 151 (a) , (b), above ); and that D e Los Santos’ $5,000 deposit</p>

but futile effort to defend the firm’s poor recordkeeping. The petition for discipline did not charge violations of the rules governing a lawyer’s obligation of supervision (Mass. R. Prof. C. 5.1, 5.3), but , as explained above, we may consider such violations – amon g them, the uncharged
misconduct as to rules 8.4(h) and <strong>1.15</strong> that we found above in ¶¶ 48, 49 and 126 – as aggravating the misconduct that was charged, and proved. Matter of the Discipline of an Attorney , 448

had been accused of misusing O’Brien’s payments to him by not keeping them in an escrow account (Tr. II:139</p>
<p>At page 77<br>
Under count two , we concluded that the respondent violated Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.5(a) by
entering into contracts calling for illegal or excessive fees ; would have violated rule <strong>1.15</strong>(b) , had

<p>At page 79<br>
Under count three , we concluded that the respondent violated Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.15(b)
and 8.4(h) by negligent misuse of trust funds without deprivation; <strong>1.15</strong>(b) and 8.4(h) , but not
8.4(c) , by intentional misuse of trust funds in issuing the $4,000 check to BSI; 1.15(b) by</p>

simply failures to comply with one or more provisions of Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>, is unavailing. Although the
language of the rule makes none of these distinctions, but merely requires that funds be deposited in a trust</p>

greater sanction where cash is involved than in other violations of Mass. R. Civ . P. <strong>1.15</strong>, we conclude that,

Third, there is the potential for confusion respecting the difference between advances
paid by clients for attorney’s fees as opposed to advances paid by clients for costs andother expenditures to third parties such as experts. Unlike a fee advance, advances madefor costs and expenses are not intended ever to become the lawyer’s property becausecosts are meant to be paid to third parties on the client’s behalf. Somewhat anomalously,rule <strong>1.15</strong>(b)(1) nonetheless permits a lawyer to commingle with her own funds costadvances that will never be hers, but she may not commingle fee advances that are
intended to become hers. We are not suggesting that there is anything wrong with therule as written; we wish only to point out that the anomaly fosters understandableconfusion over the handling of both kinds of advances.</p>

We reject the respondent&#8217;s argument that this case is like Matter of Wise, 433 Mass. 80, 80,
92 (2000) (six-month suspension appropriate for attorney whose actions in connection withsingle matter were &quot;marked by a conflict of interest,&quot; and &quot;motivated by selfishness andanger,&quot; but caused no harm), or Matter of Pike, 408 Mass. 740, 745-746 (1990) (six-monthsuspension for attorney&#8217;s single incident of misconduct, his representation of both landlordand tenant in lease negotiation, affirmed, although &quot;there had been a recommendation of asuspension of one year, the court would have followed it&quot;). Here the record reveals a patternof misconduct, some incidents of which occurred during bar counsel&#8217;s investigation. See Matterof Saab, 406 Mass. 315, 327 (1989) (&quot;consideration of the cumulative effect of severalviolations is proper&quot;). The two-year suspension recommended by the board would be markedlydisparate from the discipline imposed in similar cases. See, e.g., Matter of Luongo, 416 Mass.308, 311-312 (1993) (indefinite suspension for attorney who commingled funds as to workintentional, although temporary, deprivation of client&#8217;s use of funds, associated withnonlawyer, and failed to cooperate with bar counsel&#8217;s inquiries); Matter of Voros, 11 Mass.Att&#8217;y Discipline Rep. R. 287 (1995) (indefinite suspension for attorney who misrepresented hislegal expertise, net worth, and financial viability of partnership in which he engaged withclient whom he failed to inform of conflict of interest). Cf. Matter of Segal, 430 Mass. 359,368 (1999) (two-year suspension for experienced real estate attorney who made falsestatements and material omissions regarding improper loans); Matter of McIntyre, 426 Mass.1012, <strong>1015</strong> (1998) (two-year suspension for mishandling of client funds). Here, therespondent&#8217;s conduct was far more egregious than conflicted representation. His conflictedconduct is characterized less by a divided loyalty and more by a motivation to subjugate theinterests of his clients to his own.
As to restitution, the respondent asserts that the appeal panel incorrectly determined that he</p>

The hearing committee concluded that the respondent did not violate the charged rulesbecause independent counsel was present by virtue of Pendergast&#8217;s presence and activeinvolvement in the meeting. The hearing committee noted that even if the respondent&#8217;sconduct at the June 3, 1998, meeting did constitute a violation of charged disciplinary rules,the &quot;recommended sanction would not be altered.&quot;

permanently deprived of the money . Our approach to the question does not dif fer from the allocation of</p>
<p>At page 9<br>
funds, negligent misuse, or misuse with deprivation, &quot;whether intentional or negligent,&quot; and that all are
simply failures to comply with one or more provisions of Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>, is unavailing. Although the
language of the rule makes none of these distinctions, but merely requires that funds be deposited in a trust</p>

recognize that the new rule is harsher than previous treatment for similar behavior , and will also result in far
greater sanction where cash is involved than in other violations of Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>, we conclude that,
by its very nature, cash must be treated dif ferently than other client assets. Above all, we &quot;must consider</p>

Conclusion
One purpose of discipline is to protect the public and deter similar conduct byother lawyers. Matter of Kersting, 151 Ariz. 171, 726 P.2d 587 (1986). Anotherpurpose is to instill public confidence in the bar&#8217;s integrity. Matter of Horwitz, 180Ariz. 20, 29, 881 P.2d, 352, 362 (1994). Yet another purpose is to maintain theintegrity of the legal system. In re Fioramonti, 176 Ariz. 182, 187, 859 P.2d <strong>1315</strong>,1320 (1993). Therefore, having considered Respondent&#8217;s misconduct, application ofthe Standards, including factors present in aggravation and mitigation, and aproportionality analysis, the Commission recommends a three (3) year suspension,restitution and costs of these disciplinary proceedings and upon reinstatement, two(2) years probation (LOMAP and EEP).

excessive fee, she owed nothing to the Parkers and therefore was not required to set asideany money she legitimately earned by placing it in a trust account. There are two flaws in herargument. The first is that her conduct is in violation of the plain language of Mass. R. Prof.C. <strong>1.15</strong> (b)(2)(ii), which requires an attorney to restore withdrawn funds to a trust account ifthe right of the attorney to receive the funds has been disputed and the attorney is notifiedof the dispute within a reasonable time after the funds were withdrawn. Second, therespondent never placed the funds in a trust account hi the first place. The respondent hadnot earned all the funds at the time she deposited them to her personal account, andtherefore she commingled client funds with her personal funds.
There is no merit to the claim that the Parkers had consented to the posting of confidential</p>

The hearing committee concluded that the respondent committed a breach of his ethicalobligations by failing to deposit his client&#8217;s funds in a trust account; failing adequately toaccount for the funds to the client or to her guardian; and negligently failing to safeguard theclient&#8217;s property and turn it over to the client or her guardian. See Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.1, 426Mass. 1308 (1998); Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.2 (a), 426 Mass. 1310 (1998); Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.3, 426

9 However,</p>
<p>At page 4<br>
There was more than ample evidence in this case to support the board&#8217;s findings that the
respondent failed to deposit the client&#8217;s cash in a client trust account; failed to keep properrecords of the cash and the disbursements made on the client&#8217;s behalf; did not make acomplete accounting of the cash when requested to do so by the successor guardian; and wasultimately unable to account for a portion of the total funds he received. Indeed, therespondent admitted that he stored the cash in his office safe and that he did not know theexact amount he received. Therefore, the board concluded correctly that the respondentviolated Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong> (a), (b), (d), and (e).
Absent the presumption that is to be applied in the future, there is also substantial evidence</p>
<p>At page 6 respondent did not benefit from the misconduct, and the respondent&#8217;s sincere efforts to assistthe client, no reasonable attorney could believe that holding $11,000 to $12,000 in cash in anoffice safe, without making a proper record of the amount involved and withoutcommunicating with the client about the money, could constitute proper management of theclient&#8217;s funds. The board determined correctly that the respondent&#8217;s negligent handling of theclient&#8217;s cash, and his failure timely to turn over the $2,040 to the client or her guardian, wasin violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong> (a), (b), (d), and (e).
The sanction for similar misconduct in previous cases has been a public reprimand. See, e.g.,</p>
<p>At page 6<br>
Although the board&#8217;s findings concerning the respondent&#8217;s violations of the ethical rules are
well supported, we conclude that the board&#8217;s recommendation of a two-month suspension isinadequate. The respondent has received prior discipline (a private admonition) for failingtimely to probate. The board properly considered this factor in aggravation. Furthermore, therespondent&#8217;s eight-month delay in bringing his discovery of $2,040 of the missing cash to theattention of his client, her guardian, or bar counsel is troubling. While the hearing committeedetermined correctly that this conduct violated Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong> (a) and (b), neither thehearing committee nor the board accorded sufficient weight to this factor.
That the respondent relied on advice of counsel in holding onto the funds for their potential</p>
<p>At page 8<br>
respect to what otherwise appears to be a violation. It is thus not unfair to rely on a
presumption, one that can be rebutted, that unaccounted-for cash received from or on behalfof a client is deemed to have been commingled in violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong> and thatthe client has been permanently deprived of the money. Our approach to the question doesnot differ from the allocation of responsibilities that attend other fiduciary relationships suchas that of trustee and beneficiary. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 172 comment b(1959). See also Samia
v. Central Oil Co. , 339 Mass. 101, 126 (1959).</p>
<p>At page 8 n adopting this approach, we do not mean to suggest that the distinction between an intentto deprive the client of funds and negligent handling of cash without such an intent has beeneliminated. Bar counsel&#8217;s argument that there is no distinction in the rules of professionalconduct between misplacement of client funds, negligent misuse, or misuse with deprivation,&quot;whether intentional or negligent,&quot; and that all are simply failures to comply with one or moreprovisions of Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong>, is unavailing. Although the language of the rule makesnone of these distinctions, but merely requires that funds be deposited in a trust account,accounted for, and returned timely to the client on request, our case law has consistentlymaintained different sanctions for commingling alone, negligent misuse, intentional misuse,and intentional misuse with deprivation. See Matter of Schoepfer
, 426 Mass. 183, 187 (1997);</p>
<p>At page 8<br>
to be imposed for misconduct occurring after the date of the issuance of the rescript of this
opinion. While we recognize that the new rule is harsher than previous treatment for similarbehavior, and will also result in far greater sanction where cash is involved than in otherviolations of Mass. R. Civ. P. <strong>1.15</strong>, we conclude that, by its very nature, cash must be treateddifferently than other client assets. Above all, we &quot;must consider what measure of disciplineis necessary to protect the public and deter other attorneys from the same behavior.&quot; Matter
of Concemi , 422 Mass. 326, 329 (1996), citing Matter of Saab , 406 Mass. 315, 328 (1989).</p>

]). However, as the hearing committee
found, due to the lack of records it is impossible to determine the exact amount of cash hidden by the client orreceived by the respondent. This is precisely the problem that is likely to arise any time cash is involved, and thatMass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong> is designed to avoid. See part 4, infra

55. In general, based on our assessment of the Respondent’s credibility and the other credible
evidence, we make the following findings about the Respondent’s state of mind andmotivations. During the negotiations with Warner-Lambert, the Respondent was motivated bythe best of intentions on behalf of his clients, and sincerely and reasonably believed that hewas obtaining the best result possible for his clients. He believed that his chances forsuccessfully prosecuting a Magnusson-Moss Warranty Act class action were dim. (The law citedin the post-hearing briefs indicates that this belief was a reasonable one.) We find, however,that the Respondent engaged in rationalization about his relationship with his clients andabout his reasons for not disclosing the settlement terms to his clients (especially the fee hewas being paid and his clients’ retention of their rights). We further find that, once his clientsbegan questioning the terms and conditions on which, and manner in which, the dispute withWarner-Lambert was settled, the Respondent intentionally made deceptive statements. At thehearing, the Respondent testified that he now understands that he committed multiple errorsof judgment in connection with his representation of his clients. Tr. <strong>1:158</strong>-162, 193-95. Wecredit this testimony, and find that the Respondent now understands that the individuals werehis clients, and that he had a duty to keep them fully informed about the settlement of theirclaims.</p>

Background. Bar counsel filed a petition for discipline alleging that Franchitto violated
disciplinary rules by making disbursements in three residential mortgage closings without goodfunds for one client and subsequently conducting closings for other clients without informingparticipants that his disbursement checks could be dishonored because of account shortfallsstemming from the unfunded closings. A hearing committee appointed by the Board of BarOverseers (board) found that Franchitto was the victim of his client&#8217;s (the mortgage lender&#8217;s)fraud, but nonetheless that he violated the good funds statute, G. L. c. 183, § 63B, andrecord keeping provisions of the rules of professional conduct. Mass. R. Prof. C. <strong>1.15</strong> (a), 426Mass. 1363 (1998). The committee also concluded that Franchitto had engaged in conductinvolving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, Mass. R. Prof. C. 8.4 (c), 426 Mass.1429 (1998), by failing to disclose the account shortfalls at the subsequent closings. As asanction, the committee recommended a public reprimand. Both parties appealed to a panelof the board, which recommended the same sanction. The full board adopted the panel&#8217;sreport and recommendation. Bar counsel objected to the sanction. An information was filed bythe board and heard by the single justice, who imposed a public reprimand. On appeal, barcounsel argues that the sanction improperly deviates from the presumptive sanctions set forthin Matter of Schoepfer, 426 Mass. 183 (1997), and Matter of the Discipline of an Attorney, 392Mass. 827 (1984) (Three Attorneys). Further, bar counsel points out that Franchitto waspreviously suspended from the practice of law and argues that he should be suspended againunder the principle that &quot;in the absence of mitigating factors, discipline should proceed inincrements of escalating severity.&quot; Matter of Chambers, 421 Mass. 256, 260 (1995).
