										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many consequences to a drug conviction, some well-known and others not obvious until you face it. One little-known consequence of a drug conviction in DC is that the DC Department of Motor Vehicles will automatically revoke your driver&#8217;s license. DC Code §&nbsp;50-1403.02 requires the DMV to revoke DC driving privileges for any adult or juvenile conviction (or what they call in the juvenile system &#8220;adjudication&#8221;) for a drug offense. This is true whether the drug charge had anything to do with driving or whether you even have a driver&#8217;s license.*<span id="more-552"></span></p>
<p>Unlike many other reasons that the DMV will revoke or suspend a driver&#8217;s license, this provision does not provide for any notice to be given before the revocation (even though taking away a person&#8217;s license without notice is a violation of due process). And many lawyers don&#8217;t tell their clients that they will lose their license if they plead guilty to a drug charge. They should.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions: DC&#8217;s probation before judgment for first offenders under DC Code § 48-904.01(e) and a guilty plea under a deferred sentencing agreement are not considered convictions and should not lead to license revocation.</p>
<p>All in all, this is just another reason to think hard about taking a misdemeanor drug charge to trial rather than pleading guilty. There&#8217;s no such thing as an unwinnable case.</p>
<p>*If you don&#8217;t have a driver&#8217;s license, since there is nothing to take away, the statute says that this will delay the availability of a license for up to two years</p>

<p>A chemist at the DEA Mid-Atlantic Laboratory wrote in a report that three samples suspected to be marijuana turned purple in a <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/the-myth-of-specific-identification-of-marijuana-in-criminal-court-part-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duquenois-Levine color test.</a> The problem is that the picture of the test (not included in the report but in the analyst&#8217;s case-file) showed only one sample that might conceivably indicate the sample was marijuana (and even that one is weak).<span id="more-463"></span></p>
<p>Is there any reason for the analyst to photograph the color test against a green background other than to obscure the real colors obtained? Compare the picture above against an example of what the D-L color test should look like (copied from <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin McShane</a>&#8216;s site for purposes of illustration and comment):</p>
<figure style="width: 312px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/modified-Duquenois-Levine.png?resize=312%2C404" width="312" height="404"  data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This is what a Duquenois-Levine color test of marijuana should look like. The top is purple and the bottom is pink.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #444444; line-height: 1.7;">The truth is that color tests like these are not specific for marijuana, meaning that the test may show a color even if the sample is not marijuana &#8211; there&#8217;s a huge list of plants and chemicals that could cause a purple or purple-ish color. But if there is no color at all, the chemists tell us in their testimony that this would indicate that the sample is not marijuana. So by that token, the lack of color in the test would be evidence that the sample is not marijuana. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #444444; line-height: 1.7;">You can only get this evidence by requesting the information from the government and cross-examining their expert.&nbsp;</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>A colleague recently asked me whether the DC post-and-forfeit procedure after arrest is properly considered a conviction under federal and immigration law. The simple answer is that the post-and-forfeit procedure does not equate to a conviction.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A colleague recently asked me whether the DC post-and-forfeit procedure after arrest is properly considered a conviction under federal and immigration law. The simple answer is that the post-and-forfeit procedure does not equate to a conviction.<span id="more-421"></span></p>
<p>Under immigration laws, a conviction is defined as follows (in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A)</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>The term &#8220;conviction&#8221; means, with respect to an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court or, if adjudication of guilt has been withheld, where:</p>
<p>(i) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt, and</p>
<p>(ii) the judge has ordered some form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien’s liberty to be imposed.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Under this definition, the DC post-and-forfeit procedure does not involve a conviction.</p>
<p>The DC code regarding its post-and-forfeit procedure is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>§5-335.01. Enforcement of the post-and-forfeit procedure.</p>
<p>(a) For the purposes of this section, the term “post-and-forfeit procedure” shall mean the procedure enforced as part of the criminal justice system in the District of Columbia whereby a person charged with certain misdemeanors may simultaneously post and forfeit an amount as collateral (which otherwise would serve as security upon release to ensure the arrestee’s appearance at trial) and thereby obtain a full and final resolution of the criminal charge.</p>
<p>(b) The resolution of a criminal charge using the post-and-forfeit procedure is not a conviction of a crime and shall not be equated to a criminal conviction. The fact that a person resolved a charge using the post-and-forfeit procedure may not be relied upon by any court of the District of Columbia or any agency of the District of Columbia in any subsequent criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding or administrative action to impose any sanction, penalty, enhanced sentence, or civil disability.</p></blockquote>
<p>One thing that is apparent is that there is no admission or adjudication of guilt in the post-and-forfeit procedure and no judge imposes a punishment.</p>
<p>The federal district court in DC has also determined that the post-and-forfeit procedure does not involve a conviction. For example, in a recent case, the DC district court stated that “posting and forfeiting is not an admission of guilt, and it does not result in a criminal conviction.” <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9516433629804700761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fox v. District of Columbia</em>, 851 F. Supp. 2d 20, 25 (D.D.C. 2012)</a>. The court went on to explain that “the payment does not result in a criminal conviction and it cannot trigger any of the collateral consequences of a criminal conviction, [therefore] it is not appropriately likened to a criminal sentence.” <em>Id.</em> at 31.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To live up to its name, forensic science must conform to the scientific method, which the Oxford English Dictionary defines as “consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses.” The scientific method seeks above all to prove or disprove hypotheses through testing in order to determine whether a particular conclusion is reliable. If recent history has taught us anything, it&#8217;s that forensic science often falls short of this ideal. But we as criminal defense lawyers can&#8217;t expose these failings without better information on lab procedures. I have written about cross-examining drug experts <a title="In Drug Cases, Cross-Examine that “Expert”!" href="http://new.theclementsfirm.com/?p=362">here</a>.<span id="more-381"></span></p>
<p>The DEA laboratory used by the District of Columbia seems to fight tooth and nail to keep any information that could be used to test or verify its reliability out of the hand of criminal defense lawyers. Without this information, we cannot effectively cross-examine drug analysts. Therefore, it&#8217;s very important to fight just as hard to try to get this info.</p>
<p>The National Academy of Sciences (in an essential report you can get <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/228091.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) has stated that there are two very important questions that should be answered to determine whether particular forensic science evidence should be admitted and relied upon in criminal trials:</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) the extent to which a particular forensic discipline is founded on a reliable scientific methodology that gives it the capacity to accurately analyze evidence and report findings and</p>
<p>(2) the extent to which practitioners in a particular forensic discipline rely on human interpretation that could be tainted by error, the threat of bias, or the absence of sound operational procedures and robust performance standards.<a title="" href="#_ftn1"><br />
</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7136706767059629384&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts</i></a>, quoted the NRC Report at length and recognized that “ forensic scientists . . . sometimes face pressure to sacrifice appropriate methodology for the sake of expediency.” “Confrontation is designed to weed out not only the fraudulent analyst, but the incompetent one as well.” Is it a coincidence that the laboratory at issue in this case is the same one that has since been the subject of scandal after it found two analysts who falsified test results? (These two analysts are <a href="http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/09/annie_dookhan_former_state_che.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Annie Dookhan</a> and  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/20/justice/massachusetts-chemist-charged/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sonja Frank</a>).</p>
<p>The Court further noted that there is “wide variability across forensic science disciplines with regard to techniques, methodologies, reliability, types and numbers of potential errors, research, general acceptability, and published material.” The Court recognized that “[c]onfrontation is one means of assuring accurate forensic analysis,” and the one means guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, but surely confrontation regarding techniques, reliability, and how a forensic analyst applied the particular prescribed methodology can only be effective if that information is disclosed to the defense. At the very least, criminal defense lawyers should try to get the following:</p>
<div>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Standard Operating Procedures, Protocols, and Methods</span></b></p>
<p>Defense access to standard operating procedures and methodologies is important both to allow defense counsel to test the reliability of the standard procedures and methods, and to determine whether the testifying analyst actually followed the standard procedures. These are two main questions identified by the NRC Report as determining the reliability of specific forensic evidence.</p>
<p>Other authorities agree, stating “publication of a laboratory&#8217;s work product and data used in . . . analysis, as well as independent replication and validation studies, are essential prerequisites to reliability.”  <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Schwartz,+447+N.W.+2d+422&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,21&amp;case=1711603818802243408&amp;scilh=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>State v. Schwartz</em></a>, 447 N.W. 2d 422, 428 (Minn. Sup. Ct. 1989) (citing standards set out by the Technical Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods, a group of 31 scientists coordinated by the FBI). Some commentators suggest that laboratory protocols should be publicly available and even placed on the internet. P. Giannelli, E. Imwinkelried, et al., 1 <a href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/store/catalog/booktemplate/productdetail.jsp?pageName=relatedProducts&amp;prodId=7575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scientific Evidence</a> §3.02, p. 160 (5th ed., Dec. 2012).<a title="" href="#_ftn3"><br />
</a></p>
<p>“[N]o one disputes that the procedures such an expert actually employs are discoverable.” <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=cole+v.+state,+835+a.2d+600&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,21&amp;case=18337717452595120703&amp;scilh=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Cole v. State</i></a>, 835 A. 2d 600, 609 (Md. Ct. of App., 2003). While some methods may be theoretically valid, a particular analysis may fall short. Giannelli and Imwinkelried paraphrase the late scientific expert Melvin Lewis as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is no more correct to say that (GC/MS) detects (a drug) than to say that a violin produces music. Unfortunately, it is much easier for unsound scientific opinion to appear valid than for the product of an incompetently manipulated violin to sound euphonic.” <a title="" href="#_ftn5"><br />
</a></p></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proficiency Reports, Calibration and Maintenance Records</span></b></p>
<p>Proficiency reports should be discoverable as they are important to help the court determine the weight to give to the forensic analyst’s conclusions. As the court explained in <em>Cole</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The calibration record for the machine the chemist used and the chemist&#8217;s own proficiency testing records with regard to the specific testing devices and written procedures are potentially relevant to the case because an improperly calibrated machine or a machine operated by a chemist who was not proficient in its use could lead to an inaccurate result.”<a title="" href="#_ftn7"><br />
</a></p></blockquote>
<div>
<p>Requesting laboratory information is not a panacea, however. In my recent experience, DC prosecutors have amended charges to &#8220;attempted&#8221; possession rather than producing this information &#8211; in &#8220;attempted&#8221; possession, the government doesn&#8217;t have to prove that the seized substance is an illegal drug, but it does have to prove that the defendant intended to possess a drug.</p>
<p>In some cases, such as where the government is going on a theory of &#8220;constructive&#8221; possession (the drugs aren&#8217;t seen on the defendant, but the government claims defendant has control of them), this raises the burden of proof on the prosecutors a bit. This may put the defense in a better position for trial or make the prosecutors more willing to give a better plea offer. There&#8217;s nothing to be lost in asking for this lab info, and much that can be gained.</p>

I was very disheartened to see that when it came time for the DEA chemist&#8217;s testimony, the defense lawyer did not challenge her qualifications, did not challenge the identification of the seized evidence as marijuana, and did not cross-examine the chemist <em>at all</em>, not even to have the chemist at least list the procedures performed, etc.<span id="more-362"></span></p>
<p>And unfortunately, this is the normal standard procedure: every day in courts around the country, defense lawyers play chicken with the government; the defense exercises its confrontation clause rights and insists that the government call the chemist hoping for a no-show, but doesn&#8217;t do anything when she does show. The government (and frankly, most judges) would prefer that we just trust the black box of its pseudo-science: this is X drug, because we, the experts, say so.</p>
<p>Civil lawyers intuitively know that experts are fallible, usually in favor of the party paying, and judges also know to treat expert testimony <em>in civil cases</em> with skepticism. But this skepticism goes out the window in criminal cases. If the forensic crime lab scandals of the past few years have taught us nothing else, it&#8217;s that we can&#8217;t trust the government&#8217;s &#8220;scientific experts&#8221; to be unbiased.   Defendants, our clients, deserve more.<!--more--></p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.thetakeaway.org/2012/dec/03/crime-lab-chemist-allegedly-tampered-evidence-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent Massachusetts forensic</a> <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2012/09/30/how-chemist-drug-lab-scandal-circumvented-safeguards/A29LZnAw1eW4hvjn4xX7rL/story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crime lab scandal</a>, <a href="http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/09/annie_dookhan_former_state_che.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Annie Dookhan</a>, a drug chemist, is believed to have falsified test results for many years &#8211; this chemist was responsible for the tests of 60,000 samples in 34,000 criminal cases. Many of those cases resulted in convictions (1,141 inmates have been identified so far). Could better cross-examination have helped uncover her fraud more quickly?</p>
<p>This is something that&#8217;s easy to question in hindsight, but it&#8217;s hard to see how we as defense lawyers can go wrong if we &#8220;QUESTION EVERYTHING&#8221;, as my new hero <a href="http://www.dctrafficattorney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bryan Brown</a> says.*</p>
<p>So, where to start? Another new hero, <a href="http://www.themcshanefirm.com/pa-dui-attorneys/justin-j-mcshane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin McShane</a>, <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/the-myth-of-specific-identification-of-marijuana-in-criminal-court-part-3-what-is-microscopic-morphological-examination-is-it-a-good-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publishes</a> <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/the-myth-of-specific-identification-of-marijuana-in-criminal-court-part-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tons of free</a> <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/mass-spectroscopy-for-lawyers-part-9-other-topics-of-interest-in-gc-ms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">information on the science, or lack thereof</a>, behind drug testing. There&#8217;s lots of fodder for cross-examination there. I am finding that our local DEA lab doesn&#8217;t even want to disclose its practices and standards, so that&#8217;s something we get to fight about. I can also highly recommend Jim Shellow&#8217;s book, <a href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/store/catalog/booktemplate/productdetail.jsp?pageName=relatedProducts&amp;prodId=prod12340326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cross-Examination of the Analyst in Drug Prosecutions</a>. Shellow also wrote <a href="http://www.nacdl.org/Champion.aspx?id=22942" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an article for the Champion</a> (membership req&#8217;d) suggesting that defense lawyers call analysts out for not using the computer matching that most GC/MS machines can do, but rely on subjective spectra matching. Shellow was cited by Scalia in the prophetic <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7136706767059629384&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts</a> majority opinion.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that since I have started pushing on these issues, I can&#8217;t seem to get a drug case to trial. I&#8217;m not reading too much into it, but I can&#8217;t see how one can go wrong by being ready to force the government to prove its case. It&#8217;s what my clients want from me.</p>
<p>* Bryan Brown is one of the primary lawyers responsible for blowing the lid off of the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/09/AR2010060906257.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breathalyzer scandal in DC</a>, so to speak.</p>
