										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today in Baltimore Immigration Court, I was lucky to be able to help a client from Eritrea get asylum.  My client had been subjected to almost six months incommunicado detention where she was raped and beaten after speaking out against the government at a work meeting.  Like many Eritrean women, she had also been subjected to female genital mutilation (cutting/circumcision) that continues to cause her much pain.  She was granted asylum on two grounds: membership in the particular social group of Tegrigna women opposed to FGM, and on account of imputed political opinion.  I am very grateful to have been a part of helping this client get asylum protection from removal.</p>
