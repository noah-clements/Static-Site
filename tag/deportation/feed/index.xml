										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are an immigrant here in the US with temporary protected status (TPS), you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> lose this status if you are convicted of two misdemeanors.  <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-7226.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INA §244(c)(2)(B)</a>.  And even if you have been in the US a long time and have US citizen children, you will not be allowed to stay unless your citizen (or LPR) children (or spouse or parents) would suffer &#8220;extreme and exceptionally unusual hardship.&#8221; This form of relief is called &#8220;non-LPR cancellation of removal,&#8221; and is <a title="Cancellation of Removal for non-Permanent Residents Checklist" href="http://new.theclementsfirm.com/?p=175">extremely difficult to qualify for.</a></p>
<p>Often for the first offense of something like DUI, defense lawyers will advise clients to take a deal for an &#8220;alternate disposition&#8221; not resulting in any jailtime.  For example, in Maryland we have a disposition called &#8220;probation before judgment&#8221; (PBJ), which is not considered a conviction under state law.  Md. Crim. Proc. §6-220(g)(3).  The only problem is that in the immigration context, conviction is defined by federal law, not state law.  <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sec_08_00001101----000-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INA §101(a)(48).</a>  Under federal law, a conviction includes some finding or admission of guilt or facts and &#8220;some form of punishment,&#8221; including a suspended sentence and/or fine.  <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8515850200529514531&amp;q=united+states+v+Zamudio,+314+F.3d+517&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US v. Zamudio, 314 F. 3d 517, 522 (10th Cir. 2002)</a>.  To avoid a conviction, you would have to avoid imposition of any suspended sentence or fine.  So even though the defense lawyer tells you that you are getting off relatively scott-free, with some vague warning of immigration consequences, those immigration consequences need to be considered carefully.  If you have TPS, you can&#8217;t get a  second conviction for anything.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In another example of reality undercutting the hysterical claims by anti-immigration proponents that border failures and a flood of new illegal immigrants require discriminatory state laws to &#8220;fill in the gap,&#8221;  the <a href="http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/mexican-migration-patterns-signal-new-immigration-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Immigration Policy Center reports</a> that immigration from Mexico (the largest source of immigration) has <strong><em>decreased</em> <em>by 60%</em></strong> since 2006!  But this does not mean that the Administration&#8217;s &#8220;enforcement-only&#8221; approach is working.  <span id="more-143"></span>Indeed,  as the Immigration Policy Center states:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reports also reveal that, despite years of <a href="http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/default/files/docs/Enforcement_During_Recession_090910_0.pdf">increased spending</a> on immigration enforcement, including <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/enforcement-ar-2010.pdf">record-setting</a> numbers of deportations under the Obama Administration—and despite the impact of a recession and persistently stagnant labor market in the United States—<em>fewer</em> Mexican immigrants are leaving the country now than in years past.  Moreover, the Mexican American population continues to increase, and Mexican immigrants in the United States have become the parents of a new generation of Mexican Americans.  In other words, Mexican immigrants are staying and they are becoming more and more integrated into U.S. society.</p></blockquote>
<p>Contrary to statements by anti-immigrant groups, there is no &#8220;<a href="http://www.fairus.org/site/PageNavigator/site/PageNavigator/facts/immigration_101.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unprecedented rise</a> in the number of immigrants admitted to this country every year&#8221;.  Rather <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/ois_ill_pe_2010.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three-fifths</a> of unauthorized immigrants have been here more than ten years and many are having children.  What this means is that harsher enforcement methods and new state anti-immigrant laws will disproportionately serve to break up families, harming US citizen children, and disrupt communities, without much effect on incoming immigration, which has already drastically dropped.</p>
