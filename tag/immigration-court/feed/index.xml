										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A colleague recently asked me whether the DC post-and-forfeit procedure after arrest is properly considered a conviction under federal and immigration law. The simple answer is that the post-and-forfeit procedure does not equate to a conviction.<span id="more-421"></span></p>
<p>Under immigration laws, a conviction is defined as follows (in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A)</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>The term &#8220;conviction&#8221; means, with respect to an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court or, if adjudication of guilt has been withheld, where:</p>
<p>(i) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt, and</p>
<p>(ii) the judge has ordered some form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien’s liberty to be imposed.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Under this definition, the DC post-and-forfeit procedure does not involve a conviction.</p>
<p>The DC code regarding its post-and-forfeit procedure is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>§5-335.01. Enforcement of the post-and-forfeit procedure.</p>
<p>(a) For the purposes of this section, the term “post-and-forfeit procedure” shall mean the procedure enforced as part of the criminal justice system in the District of Columbia whereby a person charged with certain misdemeanors may simultaneously post and forfeit an amount as collateral (which otherwise would serve as security upon release to ensure the arrestee’s appearance at trial) and thereby obtain a full and final resolution of the criminal charge.</p>
<p>(b) The resolution of a criminal charge using the post-and-forfeit procedure is not a conviction of a crime and shall not be equated to a criminal conviction. The fact that a person resolved a charge using the post-and-forfeit procedure may not be relied upon by any court of the District of Columbia or any agency of the District of Columbia in any subsequent criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding or administrative action to impose any sanction, penalty, enhanced sentence, or civil disability.</p></blockquote>
<p>One thing that is apparent is that there is no admission or adjudication of guilt in the post-and-forfeit procedure and no judge imposes a punishment.</p>
<p>The federal district court in DC has also determined that the post-and-forfeit procedure does not involve a conviction. For example, in a recent case, the DC district court stated that “posting and forfeiting is not an admission of guilt, and it does not result in a criminal conviction.” <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9516433629804700761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fox v. District of Columbia</em>, 851 F. Supp. 2d 20, 25 (D.D.C. 2012)</a>. The court went on to explain that “the payment does not result in a criminal conviction and it cannot trigger any of the collateral consequences of a criminal conviction, [therefore] it is not appropriately likened to a criminal sentence.” <em>Id.</em> at 31.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, in browsing a well-known local lawyer&#8217;s website, I found the following &#8220;News&#8221; article on their blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>Attorney X convinced a [local] prosecutor to dismiss Armed Robbery charges, all felonies, and all gun charges, despite the defendant being caught nearly red-handed with a shotgun in his fleeing vehicle.</p>
<p>The defendant plead to Second Degree Assault, a misdemeanor, giving him a strong chance to avoid certain deportation that he would have faced with any felony or gun charge. He will be eligible for parole in one month.</p></blockquote>
<p>While there may be some ethical concern over publicizing past successes without adequately informing potential clients that there is no guarantee of such success in any particular case, that is not my main concern. The biggest problem with this self-serving news article is that it may harm the client in the future.<span id="more-399"></span></p>
<p>What if the ICE Assistant Chief Counsel (the title of immigration prosecutors) in a future deportation case against that client stumbles across this &#8220;article&#8221;? Unfortunately, it would be all too easy for the ICE prosecutor to find. Can the admission by the client&#8217;s attorney be used to try to form the requisite admission of facts?</p>
<p>The fact that this article is not part of the official record of conviction does not end the inquiry &#8211; admission of underlying facts can also be used to show that a conviction is one that leads to removability or deportation. The client would then be in the position of arguing that although his attorney may have admitted the underlying facts, he did not do so himself. Would that argument be successful? I don&#8217;t think anyone knows at this point, but it&#8217;s much better to avoid the situation altogether.</p>
<p>And this situation is avoidable. Is it so important to promote the practice that the attorney should put this up in the first place? Is this attorney hoping that other potential clients &#8220;caught nearly red-handed&#8221; with guns in their fleeing cars will think the attorney will also get them off?</p>
<p>I think a potential client would be better served in knowing that no matter what the alleged facts in their case, the attorney will never divulge them to serve the attorney&#8217;s own interests. They should not be divulged at any time except to the extent that it might help the client.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Under certain circumstances, some people put into removal proceedings who are not Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) may be eligible for a form of relief called &#8220;Cancellation of Removal&#8221;, which allows certain non-LPRs to &#8220;adjust status&#8221; and become an LPR.  In plain English, Cancellation of Removal allows some non-green card holders to ask the Immigration Judge to &#8220;cancel&#8221; their removal proceedings and allow them to stay in the U.S. as an LPR.  The statute that provides this relief is <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-6337.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INA §240A(b)(1).</a>  (There other types of Cancellation for LPRs and for battered spouses or children of LPRs or citizens &#8211; <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-6337.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INA §240A(a) &amp; (b)(2)</a>, respectively). The purpose of this post is to provide a checklist for eligibility for Cancellation of Removal for non-permanent residents.</p>
<p><span id="more-175"></span>Cancellation of Removal is discretionary; the Immigration Judge <em>may</em> cancel removal and grant LPR status to a person inadmissible or removable if:</p>
<ol>
<li>the person has been continuously present in the U.S. for the past 10 years.  Special rules for calculating the physical presence time are set out in <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-6337.html#0-0-0-5031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INA §240A(d)</a>:</li>
<ol>
<li>the time period ends when the person is served a Notice to Appear;</li>
<li>departures from the U.S. of less-than 90 days does not break the physical presence time, unless the sum of all trips is more than 180 days; and</li>
<li>continuity is not required for a person absent from the U.S. because of service in the U.S. armed forces if the person enlisted in the U.S..</li>
</ol>
<li>the person has had &#8220;good moral character&#8221; during the 10-year period;
<ol>
<li>&#8220;Good moral character&#8221; is defined by statute in <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-101/0-0-0-434.html#0-0-0-1191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INA§101(f)</a> (see also the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/benchbook/resources/fundamentals/Fundamentals%20Chapter%2012.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Immigration Court Benchbook</a>). Essentially, the statute says you don&#8217;t have &#8220;good moral character&#8221; if you are:</li>
<ol>
<li>a habitual drunkard (or an addict);</li>
<li>a prostitute (or pimp) or drug trafficker;</li>
<li>a person who makes most of their income from illegal gambling;</li>
<li>a person who has given false testimony to get an immigration benefit;</li>
<li>convicted of an aggravated felony;</li>
<li>a terrorist or torturor, or someone who has belonged to an organization condoning those acts;</li>
<li>a person who has made a false claim to citizenship or voted illegally.</li>
</ol>
<li>If you are not on this list, the statute says that the Immigration Judge may still find that you did not have &#8220;good moral character&#8221; for other reasons.</li>
<li>I will post an analysis of &#8220;good moral character&#8221; soon.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>the person has not been convicted of certain crimes:
<ol>
<li>an offense under section<a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-2006.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 212(a)(2)</a> [crimes of moral turpitude, controlled substance offenses, prostitution],</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-5672.html#0-0-0-4479">237(a)(2) </a>[crimes of moral turpitude],</li>
<li>or <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-5672.html#0-0-0-4525">237(a)(3)</a> [falsifying documents or failing to register],</li>
<li>There is no time limit to this conviction bar to cancellation, but there may be a waiver of this subsection for victims of domestic violence &#8211; see <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-5672.html#0-0-0-4585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">237(a)(7)</a>; and</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>the person can show that removal would result in &#8220;exceptional and extremely unusual hardship&#8221; to his or her U.S. citizen or LPR spouse, parent, or child.
<ol>
<li>This may be the hardest criterion for most people to meet. &#8220;Exceptional and extremely unusual hardship&#8221; is defined as hardship that is substantially beyond that which would ordinarily be expected to result from your own deportation.</li>
<li>Usually people will be able to show this hardship by a US citizen or LPR child or spouse having a serious medical condition that would be worsened by the person&#8217;s removal. However, &#8220;the hardship standard is not so restrictive that only a handful of applicants, such as those who have a qualifying relative with a serious medical condition, will qualify for relief.&#8221; <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/efoia/bia/Decisions/Revdec/pdfDEC/3479.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Matter of Recinas</em>, 23 I&amp;N Dec. 467, 470 (2002)</a>.</li>
<li> I will post an analysis of &#8220;exceptional and extremely unusual hardship&#8221; soon.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The good folks at the <a href="http://www.firrp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project</a> have created a checklist for the documents helpful in a cancellation case and is available <a href="http://www.firrp.org/media/LPRCDocumentChecklist-en.doc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a>  If you are in removal proceedings and wish to seek Cancellation of Removal, feel free to contact me at (202) 630-0544 or <a title="Contact" href="http://new.theclementsfirm.com/?page_id=42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.  Enlisting the help of a good immigration lawyer is highly recommended; this is not something a person should do on his own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not too long ago, I helped a Jehovah&#8217;s Witness who was persecuted for refusal to serve in the military get asylum in immigration court.  In some countries, conscientious objectors are treated very poorly (including torture).  The US will generally not grant asylum to people who fear harsh punishment for refusing to serve in the military, but there are certain exceptions.   The two main exceptions are (1) when a draft dodger would suffer disproportionately because of race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion; and (2) when the military takes the type of actions condemned by the international community as contrary to the basic rules of human conduct.<span id="more-148"></span></p>
<p>Sovereign nations have the right to enforce draft laws and punish evaders, but when they single out certain draft dodgers because of their race, religion, ethnic or national origin, social group or political opinion, such punishment is persecution.  See <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/publ/PUBL/3d58e13b4.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNHCR Refugee Handbook ¶169.</a>  For example US courts have stated that asylum should be granted to Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses from Eritrea, who are subjected to torture and other harsh treatment for refusal to serve in the military.   <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4578196563901159015&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ghebremedhin v. Ashcroft</em>, 385 F. 3d 1116, 1120 (7th Cir. 2004)</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, there are some cases where a person can claim asylum for refusing to serve in an unpopular military.  Although the standard stated is when the refusal to serve in the military is based on genuine political, moral, or religious convictions, those convictions must involve opposition to military actions that are internationally condemned.    <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/publ/PUBL/3d58e13b4.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNHCR Refugee Handbook ¶¶170-174.</a>  As the Refugee Handbook states at ¶171:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is not enough for a person to be in disagreement with his government regarding the political justification for a particular military action. Where, however, the type of military action, with which an individual does not wish to be associated, is condemned by the international community as contrary to basic rules of human conduct, punishment for desertion or draft-evasion could, in the light of all other requirements of the definition, in itself be regarded as persecution.</p></blockquote>
<p>The key is whether the military is committing acts beyond the normal atrocities of war, such as ethnic cleansing, or other crimes against humanity.  And those acts have to be condemned by &#8220;recognized international governmental bodies,&#8221; not just non-governmental organizations, no matter how well regarded.  <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16428632758116022015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>M.A. v. INS</em>, 899 F.2d 304, 312-13 (4th Cir. 1990)</a>.  The court has to believe that the objection is genuine, however, and that the objector will actually be punished. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7842995581335054865&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,21&amp;as_vis=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Mojsilovic v. INS</em>, 156 F. 3d 743, 747 (7th Cir. 1998)</a>.</p>
<p>The examples where US courts have granted asylum for conscientious objection, however, have generally involved action against one&#8217;s own countrymen or ethnic group:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slovenian Serb deserting military service in Serbia, because of his refusal to fight Slovenians.  <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15556783950118308698&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,21&amp;as_vis=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Vujisic v. INS</em>, 224 F. 3d 578, 581 (7th Cir. 2000)</a>.</li>
<li>Afghan national who fled &#8220;dragooning&#8221; and refused to join Soviet-controlled Afghan army against rebels.   <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/intdec/vol18/2922.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Matter of Salim</em>, 18 I&amp;N Dec. 311 (BIA 1982)</a>.</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #444444; line-height: 1.7;">a Mexican Army Captain </span><a style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.7;" href="http://www.blythe.org/nytransfer-subs/99ca/Mexican_Army_Captain_Granted_Asylum_in_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">granted asylum in El Paso</a><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #444444; line-height: 1.7;"> for refusal to kill  Zapatista rebels.</span></li>
</ul>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px;">That&#8217;s not to say that the US courts haven&#8217;t or wouldn&#8217;t grant asylum for refusal to join militaries that have committed other atrocities.  I would welcome links to other cases where this has happened.</span></div>

<div><strong><em>Edit:</em> </strong>In the original post, I referred to the 4th Circuit panel decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5667591555050974291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>M.A. v. INS</em>,</a> where the court granted the petitioner relief. This decision was subsequently vacated and the <em>en banc</em> decision cited above resulted. This is why it&#8217;s not a good idea to rely on blog posts for legal research. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> For an interesting discussion of the <em>M.A. en banc</em> decision <a href="http://liftedlamp.com/2013/03/19/could-bar-rafaeli-seek-asylum-for-refusal-to-join-the-israeli-defense-forces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see this post</a> at the BenachRagland blog.</div>
