<p>A chemist at the DEA Mid-Atlantic Laboratory wrote in a report that three samples suspected to be marijuana turned purple in a <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/the-myth-of-specific-identification-of-marijuana-in-criminal-court-part-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duquenois-Levine color test.</a> The problem is that the picture of the test (not included in the report but in the analyst&#8217;s case-file) showed only one sample that might conceivably indicate the sample was marijuana (and even that one is weak).<span id="more-463"></span></p>
<p>Is there any reason for the analyst to photograph the color test against a green background other than to obscure the real colors obtained? Compare the picture above against an example of what the D-L color test should look like (copied from <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin McShane</a>&#8216;s site for purposes of illustration and comment):</p>
<figure style="width: 312px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/modified-Duquenois-Levine.png?resize=312%2C404" width="312" height="404"  data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This is what a Duquenois-Levine color test of marijuana should look like. The top is purple and the bottom is pink.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #444444; line-height: 1.7;">The truth is that color tests like these are not specific for marijuana, meaning that the test may show a color even if the sample is not marijuana &#8211; there&#8217;s a huge list of plants and chemicals that could cause a purple or purple-ish color. But if there is no color at all, the chemists tell us in their testimony that this would indicate that the sample is not marijuana. So by that token, the lack of color in the test would be evidence that the sample is not marijuana. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #444444; line-height: 1.7;">You can only get this evidence by requesting the information from the government and cross-examining their expert.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though everyone in the DC government, from the DC Council to the prosecutors at the Office of the Attorney General, knows that alcohol in the urine has a &#8220;loose correlation&#8221; to intoxication, that urinalysis is unreliable, people are still regularly prosecuted and convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) base on their urine scores.</p>
<p>Back in June of 2011, DC Chief Toxicologist Lucas Zarwell of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, stated under oath to the DC Council that urine testing cannot reliably determine impairment or blood alcohol levels. In response to a question from council member Phil Mendelson, Mr. Zarwell testified as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>MENDELSON. How accurate is urine testing for measuring blood alcohol content?</p>
<p>ZARWELL. It&#8217;s not.</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FUmhJ_jPF1E" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><span id="more-446"></span>Upon council member Mendelson’s questioning, Mr. Zarwell further explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>MENDELSON. If a urine sample is taken from me and there&#8217;s a high concentration of alcohol in it . . . doesn&#8217;t that suggest that I&#8217;m intoxicated?</p>
<p>ZARWELL. It can. That depends on the officer&#8217;s observations. It can help, I believe, be associated with that. But if you&#8217;re going to look at urine concentrations of alcohol and science, there&#8217;s a very loose correlation. There have been several studies on it. But currently, if you&#8217;re just voiding your urine or urinating into a cup, that does not correlate to a blood concentration. It could be much higher, as much as 40% higher.</p>
<p>MENDELSON. What’s the “it” there? What could be higher?</p>
<p>ZARWELL. The urine concentration could be higher than your blood alcohol concentration, it could be lower than your blood alcohol concentration. . . .</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an old way of doing things. . . . It&#8217;s better to have an officer&#8217;s observations to be able to say, yes, we&#8217;ve got alcohol present. . . .</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s no doubt from a scientific standpoint that blood and breath are a better indicator of, the best indicator to see what kind of effect alcohol is having on the brain. Because the blood is circulating the brain and that&#8217;s where the drug is having its effect and that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re seeing levels of impairment. And this has been studied heavily in the community.</p></blockquote>
<div>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested, you should watch the video. While there was a time that the government prosecutors did not attempt to introduce urine scores, I believe primarily because of confrontation and scheduling issues, that time seems to be over.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s unconscionable that the government is using these urine-alcohol scores in <em>per se </em>DUI prosecutions knowing that they are unreliable. Even worse, DC judges have been denying motions to exclude these scores as unreliable by saying that the DC Council is presumed to have considered the evidence in passing the <em>per se</em> DUI laws (a presumption that is demonstrably false). All we as defense attorneys can do is continue to file these motions in the hope that one day we will be successful. And I continue to aggressively fight this fight for my clients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was consulted on a case the other day where a person had pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession (of something that&#8217;s not marijuana) over his lawyer&#8217;s warnings that it make him removable. The judge also (post-Padilla) made sure that the person knew that there could be immigration consequences. But all the person could hear was that the prosecutor would be asking for probation if he accepted the plea deal (which was also the likely sentence even after trial).</p>
<p>So you can guess what happened. After an ill-advised trip abroad, the person received a Notice to Appear in immigration court. As a legal permanent resident with medical issues, he was eligible for cancellation of removal (which he ended up getting, with a sympathetic judge). But it could easily have gone the other way. Cancellation is a discretionary remedy, which means that the judge could have denied it if he had a good reason to do so.<span id="more-429"></span></p>
<p>I would recommend that a legal permanent resident or anyone else who is not a citizen do <a title="In Drug Cases, Cross-Examine that “Expert”!" href="http://new.theclementsfirm.com/in-drug-cases-cross-examine-that-expert/">everything</a> <a title="Why It’s Important To Get Drug Lab Info In Drug Cases" href="http://new.theclementsfirm.com/why-its-important-to-get-drug-lab-info-in-drug-cases/">possible</a> to <a title="If a Misdemeanor Could Lead to Removal of a Non-Citizen, the Charge *Might Be* Jury-Demandable In DC" href="http://new.theclementsfirm.com/if-a-misdemeanor-could-lead-to-removal-of-a-non-citizen-the-charge-might-be-jury-demandable-in-dc/">fight</a> getting a controlled substance conviction, which makes a person removable under the immigration laws  (and in most cases, I recommend that citizens also fight). When you plead guilty you have a 100% chance of conviction. Unless you are getting a significant benefit (having the government drop other charges, etc), it rarely makes sense to plead guilty to a misdemeanor possession charge. There may be grounds for a motion to surpress the arrest and evidence and you never know, the government witnesses may fail to show for trial.</p>

I was very disheartened to see that when it came time for the DEA chemist&#8217;s testimony, the defense lawyer did not challenge her qualifications, did not challenge the identification of the seized evidence as marijuana, and did not cross-examine the chemist <em>at all</em>, not even to have the chemist at least list the procedures performed, etc.<span id="more-362"></span></p>
<p>And unfortunately, this is the normal standard procedure: every day in courts around the country, defense lawyers play chicken with the government; the defense exercises its confrontation clause rights and insists that the government call the chemist hoping for a no-show, but doesn&#8217;t do anything when she does show. The government (and frankly, most judges) would prefer that we just trust the black box of its pseudo-science: this is X drug, because we, the experts, say so.</p>
<p>Civil lawyers intuitively know that experts are fallible, usually in favor of the party paying, and judges also know to treat expert testimony <em>in civil cases</em> with skepticism. But this skepticism goes out the window in criminal cases. If the forensic crime lab scandals of the past few years have taught us nothing else, it&#8217;s that we can&#8217;t trust the government&#8217;s &#8220;scientific experts&#8221; to be unbiased.   Defendants, our clients, deserve more.<!--more--></p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.thetakeaway.org/2012/dec/03/crime-lab-chemist-allegedly-tampered-evidence-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent Massachusetts forensic</a> <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2012/09/30/how-chemist-drug-lab-scandal-circumvented-safeguards/A29LZnAw1eW4hvjn4xX7rL/story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crime lab scandal</a>, <a href="http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/09/annie_dookhan_former_state_che.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Annie Dookhan</a>, a drug chemist, is believed to have falsified test results for many years &#8211; this chemist was responsible for the tests of 60,000 samples in 34,000 criminal cases. Many of those cases resulted in convictions (1,141 inmates have been identified so far). Could better cross-examination have helped uncover her fraud more quickly?</p>
<p>This is something that&#8217;s easy to question in hindsight, but it&#8217;s hard to see how we as defense lawyers can go wrong if we &#8220;QUESTION EVERYTHING&#8221;, as my new hero <a href="http://www.dctrafficattorney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bryan Brown</a> says.*</p>
<p>So, where to start? Another new hero, <a href="http://www.themcshanefirm.com/pa-dui-attorneys/justin-j-mcshane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin McShane</a>, <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/the-myth-of-specific-identification-of-marijuana-in-criminal-court-part-3-what-is-microscopic-morphological-examination-is-it-a-good-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publishes</a> <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/the-myth-of-specific-identification-of-marijuana-in-criminal-court-part-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tons of free</a> <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/mass-spectroscopy-for-lawyers-part-9-other-topics-of-interest-in-gc-ms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">information on the science, or lack thereof</a>, behind drug testing. There&#8217;s lots of fodder for cross-examination there. I am finding that our local DEA lab doesn&#8217;t even want to disclose its practices and standards, so that&#8217;s something we get to fight about. I can also highly recommend Jim Shellow&#8217;s book, <a href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/store/catalog/booktemplate/productdetail.jsp?pageName=relatedProducts&amp;prodId=prod12340326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cross-Examination of the Analyst in Drug Prosecutions</a>. Shellow also wrote <a href="http://www.nacdl.org/Champion.aspx?id=22942" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an article for the Champion</a> (membership req&#8217;d) suggesting that defense lawyers call analysts out for not using the computer matching that most GC/MS machines can do, but rely on subjective spectra matching. Shellow was cited by Scalia in the prophetic <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7136706767059629384&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts</a> majority opinion.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that since I have started pushing on these issues, I can&#8217;t seem to get a drug case to trial. I&#8217;m not reading too much into it, but I can&#8217;t see how one can go wrong by being ready to force the government to prove its case. It&#8217;s what my clients want from me.</p>
<p>* Bryan Brown is one of the primary lawyers responsible for blowing the lid off of the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/09/AR2010060906257.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breathalyzer scandal in DC</a>, so to speak.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So over the last few weeks, I have seen more and more Occupy DC protesters being brought in to DC Superior Court, arrested for this and that. DC has a system where most people charged with misdemeanors will be released on personal recognizance &#8211; allowed to go home as long as they check in with pretrial services, and follow any other orders the judge feels necessary.  These orders are put in place at the time of arraignment.</p>
<p>All of the Occupy DC folks I saw come in have been ordered to stay away from the place where they were arrested, either McPherson Square or Freedom Plaza. I had not seen any of the defense attorneys object to this &#8220;stay away&#8221; order.  It occurred to me that the stay away is an underhanded attempt by police and prosecution to stifle the protest &#8211; to deprive the movement of its leaders (if you accept that&#8217;s who the police target), or even of followers.  If everyone has to stay away from the site of the protest, there is no protest.</p>
<p><span id="more-224"></span>I was in arraignment court last week watching a couple more Occupy DC protesters ordered to stay away from Freedom Plaza and McPherson Square. One of the people charged was being defended by a friend, a fellow criminal defense lawyer taking appointed cases.  I asked her why not object to the stay away on first amendment grounds? Her client didn&#8217;t seem to have a problem with the order, and her first order of business was just getting the client released from lockup.  That&#8217;s understandable.  First things first &#8211; get out of lockup.</p>
<p>Anyway, then came my client &#8211; who really wanted me to object to this stay away for him.  I objected to the stay away order on first amendment grounds: my client was arrested during a protest, while he was engaging in political speech, and the stay away would interfere with his freedom of association. The judge overruled &#8211; said that the stay away was there to allow for a &#8220;cooling off period&#8221;. My client is a real protester &#8211; he really believes in standing up for his first amendment rights.</p>
<p>I have since filed a motion to amend the release conditions &#8211; I am frankly more than a little surprised that there don&#8217;t seem to be any first amendment cases addressing this situation. I will admit that I am not a first amendment expert &#8211; did not take that class in law school.  I am really going to have to grow to defend this client well.  And that is why I am singing this client&#8217;s praises &#8211; this is what I got into this business for &#8211; an opportunity to grow.  In the meantime, I am accepting any and all First Amendment pointers especially in the realm of protests and alleged &#8220;threats&#8221; and &#8220;attempted threats&#8221;.</p>
