										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are an immigrant here in the US with temporary protected status (TPS), you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> lose this status if you are convicted of two misdemeanors.  <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-7226.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INA §244(c)(2)(B)</a>.  And even if you have been in the US a long time and have US citizen children, you will not be allowed to stay unless your citizen (or LPR) children (or spouse or parents) would suffer &#8220;extreme and exceptionally unusual hardship.&#8221; This form of relief is called &#8220;non-LPR cancellation of removal,&#8221; and is <a title="Cancellation of Removal for non-Permanent Residents Checklist" href="http://new.theclementsfirm.com/?p=175">extremely difficult to qualify for.</a></p>
<p>Often for the first offense of something like DUI, defense lawyers will advise clients to take a deal for an &#8220;alternate disposition&#8221; not resulting in any jailtime.  For example, in Maryland we have a disposition called &#8220;probation before judgment&#8221; (PBJ), which is not considered a conviction under state law.  Md. Crim. Proc. §6-220(g)(3).  The only problem is that in the immigration context, conviction is defined by federal law, not state law.  <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sec_08_00001101----000-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INA §101(a)(48).</a>  Under federal law, a conviction includes some finding or admission of guilt or facts and &#8220;some form of punishment,&#8221; including a suspended sentence and/or fine.  <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8515850200529514531&amp;q=united+states+v+Zamudio,+314+F.3d+517&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US v. Zamudio, 314 F. 3d 517, 522 (10th Cir. 2002)</a>.  To avoid a conviction, you would have to avoid imposition of any suspended sentence or fine.  So even though the defense lawyer tells you that you are getting off relatively scott-free, with some vague warning of immigration consequences, those immigration consequences need to be considered carefully.  If you have TPS, you can&#8217;t get a  second conviction for anything.</p>
