										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Under certain circumstances, some people put into removal proceedings who are not Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) may be eligible for a form of relief called &#8220;Cancellation of Removal&#8221;, which allows certain non-LPRs to &#8220;adjust status&#8221; and become an LPR.  In plain English, Cancellation of Removal allows some non-green card holders to ask the Immigration Judge to &#8220;cancel&#8221; their removal proceedings and allow them to stay in the U.S. as an LPR.  The statute that provides this relief is <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-6337.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INA §240A(b)(1).</a>  (There other types of Cancellation for LPRs and for battered spouses or children of LPRs or citizens &#8211; <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-6337.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INA §240A(a) &amp; (b)(2)</a>, respectively). The purpose of this post is to provide a checklist for eligibility for Cancellation of Removal for non-permanent residents.</p>
<p><span id="more-175"></span>Cancellation of Removal is discretionary; the Immigration Judge <em>may</em> cancel removal and grant LPR status to a person inadmissible or removable if:</p>
<ol>
<li>the person has been continuously present in the U.S. for the past 10 years.  Special rules for calculating the physical presence time are set out in <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-6337.html#0-0-0-5031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INA §240A(d)</a>:</li>
<ol>
<li>the time period ends when the person is served a Notice to Appear;</li>
<li>departures from the U.S. of less-than 90 days does not break the physical presence time, unless the sum of all trips is more than 180 days; and</li>
<li>continuity is not required for a person absent from the U.S. because of service in the U.S. armed forces if the person enlisted in the U.S..</li>
</ol>
<li>the person has had &#8220;good moral character&#8221; during the 10-year period;
<ol>
<li>&#8220;Good moral character&#8221; is defined by statute in <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-101/0-0-0-434.html#0-0-0-1191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INA§101(f)</a> (see also the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/benchbook/resources/fundamentals/Fundamentals%20Chapter%2012.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Immigration Court Benchbook</a>). Essentially, the statute says you don&#8217;t have &#8220;good moral character&#8221; if you are:</li>
<ol>
<li>a habitual drunkard (or an addict);</li>
<li>a prostitute (or pimp) or drug trafficker;</li>
<li>a person who makes most of their income from illegal gambling;</li>
<li>a person who has given false testimony to get an immigration benefit;</li>
<li>convicted of an aggravated felony;</li>
<li>a terrorist or torturor, or someone who has belonged to an organization condoning those acts;</li>
<li>a person who has made a false claim to citizenship or voted illegally.</li>
</ol>
<li>If you are not on this list, the statute says that the Immigration Judge may still find that you did not have &#8220;good moral character&#8221; for other reasons.</li>
<li>I will post an analysis of &#8220;good moral character&#8221; soon.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>the person has not been convicted of certain crimes:
<ol>
<li>an offense under section<a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-2006.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 212(a)(2)</a> [crimes of moral turpitude, controlled substance offenses, prostitution],</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-5672.html#0-0-0-4479">237(a)(2) </a>[crimes of moral turpitude],</li>
<li>or <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-5672.html#0-0-0-4525">237(a)(3)</a> [falsifying documents or failing to register],</li>
<li>There is no time limit to this conviction bar to cancellation, but there may be a waiver of this subsection for victims of domestic violence &#8211; see <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-5672.html#0-0-0-4585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">237(a)(7)</a>; and</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>the person can show that removal would result in &#8220;exceptional and extremely unusual hardship&#8221; to his or her U.S. citizen or LPR spouse, parent, or child.
<ol>
<li>This may be the hardest criterion for most people to meet. &#8220;Exceptional and extremely unusual hardship&#8221; is defined as hardship that is substantially beyond that which would ordinarily be expected to result from your own deportation.</li>
<li>Usually people will be able to show this hardship by a US citizen or LPR child or spouse having a serious medical condition that would be worsened by the person&#8217;s removal. However, &#8220;the hardship standard is not so restrictive that only a handful of applicants, such as those who have a qualifying relative with a serious medical condition, will qualify for relief.&#8221; <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/efoia/bia/Decisions/Revdec/pdfDEC/3479.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Matter of Recinas</em>, 23 I&amp;N Dec. 467, 470 (2002)</a>.</li>
<li> I will post an analysis of &#8220;exceptional and extremely unusual hardship&#8221; soon.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The good folks at the <a href="http://www.firrp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project</a> have created a checklist for the documents helpful in a cancellation case and is available <a href="http://www.firrp.org/media/LPRCDocumentChecklist-en.doc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a>  If you are in removal proceedings and wish to seek Cancellation of Removal, feel free to contact me at (202) 630-0544 or <a title="Contact" href="http://new.theclementsfirm.com/?page_id=42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.  Enlisting the help of a good immigration lawyer is highly recommended; this is not something a person should do on his own.</p>
