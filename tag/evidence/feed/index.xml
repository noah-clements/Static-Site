<p>A chemist at the DEA Mid-Atlantic Laboratory wrote in a report that three samples suspected to be marijuana turned purple in a <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/the-myth-of-specific-identification-of-marijuana-in-criminal-court-part-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duquenois-Levine color test.</a> The problem is that the picture of the test (not included in the report but in the analyst&#8217;s case-file) showed only one sample that might conceivably indicate the sample was marijuana (and even that one is weak).<span id="more-463"></span></p>
<p>Is there any reason for the analyst to photograph the color test against a green background other than to obscure the real colors obtained? Compare the picture above against an example of what the D-L color test should look like (copied from <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin McShane</a>&#8216;s site for purposes of illustration and comment):</p>
<figure style="width: 312px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/modified-Duquenois-Levine.png?resize=312%2C404" width="312" height="404"  data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This is what a Duquenois-Levine color test of marijuana should look like. The top is purple and the bottom is pink.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #444444; line-height: 1.7;">The truth is that color tests like these are not specific for marijuana, meaning that the test may show a color even if the sample is not marijuana &#8211; there&#8217;s a huge list of plants and chemicals that could cause a purple or purple-ish color. But if there is no color at all, the chemists tell us in their testimony that this would indicate that the sample is not marijuana. So by that token, the lack of color in the test would be evidence that the sample is not marijuana. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #444444; line-height: 1.7;">You can only get this evidence by requesting the information from the government and cross-examining their expert.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though everyone in the DC government, from the DC Council to the prosecutors at the Office of the Attorney General, knows that alcohol in the urine has a &#8220;loose correlation&#8221; to intoxication, that urinalysis is unreliable, people are still regularly prosecuted and convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) base on their urine scores.</p>
<p>Back in June of 2011, DC Chief Toxicologist Lucas Zarwell of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, stated under oath to the DC Council that urine testing cannot reliably determine impairment or blood alcohol levels. In response to a question from council member Phil Mendelson, Mr. Zarwell testified as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>MENDELSON. How accurate is urine testing for measuring blood alcohol content?</p>
<p>ZARWELL. It&#8217;s not.</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FUmhJ_jPF1E" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><span id="more-446"></span>Upon council member Mendelson’s questioning, Mr. Zarwell further explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>MENDELSON. If a urine sample is taken from me and there&#8217;s a high concentration of alcohol in it . . . doesn&#8217;t that suggest that I&#8217;m intoxicated?</p>
<p>ZARWELL. It can. That depends on the officer&#8217;s observations. It can help, I believe, be associated with that. But if you&#8217;re going to look at urine concentrations of alcohol and science, there&#8217;s a very loose correlation. There have been several studies on it. But currently, if you&#8217;re just voiding your urine or urinating into a cup, that does not correlate to a blood concentration. It could be much higher, as much as 40% higher.</p>
<p>MENDELSON. What’s the “it” there? What could be higher?</p>
<p>ZARWELL. The urine concentration could be higher than your blood alcohol concentration, it could be lower than your blood alcohol concentration. . . .</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an old way of doing things. . . . It&#8217;s better to have an officer&#8217;s observations to be able to say, yes, we&#8217;ve got alcohol present. . . .</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s no doubt from a scientific standpoint that blood and breath are a better indicator of, the best indicator to see what kind of effect alcohol is having on the brain. Because the blood is circulating the brain and that&#8217;s where the drug is having its effect and that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re seeing levels of impairment. And this has been studied heavily in the community.</p></blockquote>
<div>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested, you should watch the video. While there was a time that the government prosecutors did not attempt to introduce urine scores, I believe primarily because of confrontation and scheduling issues, that time seems to be over.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s unconscionable that the government is using these urine-alcohol scores in <em>per se </em>DUI prosecutions knowing that they are unreliable. Even worse, DC judges have been denying motions to exclude these scores as unreliable by saying that the DC Council is presumed to have considered the evidence in passing the <em>per se</em> DUI laws (a presumption that is demonstrably false). All we as defense attorneys can do is continue to file these motions in the hope that one day we will be successful. And I continue to aggressively fight this fight for my clients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To live up to its name, forensic science must conform to the scientific method, which the Oxford English Dictionary defines as “consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses.” The scientific method seeks above all to prove or disprove hypotheses through testing in order to determine whether a particular conclusion is reliable. If recent history has taught us anything, it&#8217;s that forensic science often falls short of this ideal. But we as criminal defense lawyers can&#8217;t expose these failings without better information on lab procedures. I have written about cross-examining drug experts <a title="In Drug Cases, Cross-Examine that “Expert”!" href="http://new.theclementsfirm.com/?p=362">here</a>.<span id="more-381"></span></p>
<p>The DEA laboratory used by the District of Columbia seems to fight tooth and nail to keep any information that could be used to test or verify its reliability out of the hand of criminal defense lawyers. Without this information, we cannot effectively cross-examine drug analysts. Therefore, it&#8217;s very important to fight just as hard to try to get this info.</p>
<p>The National Academy of Sciences (in an essential report you can get <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/228091.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) has stated that there are two very important questions that should be answered to determine whether particular forensic science evidence should be admitted and relied upon in criminal trials:</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) the extent to which a particular forensic discipline is founded on a reliable scientific methodology that gives it the capacity to accurately analyze evidence and report findings and</p>
<p>(2) the extent to which practitioners in a particular forensic discipline rely on human interpretation that could be tainted by error, the threat of bias, or the absence of sound operational procedures and robust performance standards.<a title="" href="#_ftn1"><br />
</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7136706767059629384&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts</i></a>, quoted the NRC Report at length and recognized that “ forensic scientists . . . sometimes face pressure to sacrifice appropriate methodology for the sake of expediency.” “Confrontation is designed to weed out not only the fraudulent analyst, but the incompetent one as well.” Is it a coincidence that the laboratory at issue in this case is the same one that has since been the subject of scandal after it found two analysts who falsified test results? (These two analysts are <a href="http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/09/annie_dookhan_former_state_che.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Annie Dookhan</a> and  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/20/justice/massachusetts-chemist-charged/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sonja Frank</a>).</p>
<p>The Court further noted that there is “wide variability across forensic science disciplines with regard to techniques, methodologies, reliability, types and numbers of potential errors, research, general acceptability, and published material.” The Court recognized that “[c]onfrontation is one means of assuring accurate forensic analysis,” and the one means guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, but surely confrontation regarding techniques, reliability, and how a forensic analyst applied the particular prescribed methodology can only be effective if that information is disclosed to the defense. At the very least, criminal defense lawyers should try to get the following:</p>
<div>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Standard Operating Procedures, Protocols, and Methods</span></b></p>
<p>Defense access to standard operating procedures and methodologies is important both to allow defense counsel to test the reliability of the standard procedures and methods, and to determine whether the testifying analyst actually followed the standard procedures. These are two main questions identified by the NRC Report as determining the reliability of specific forensic evidence.</p>
<p>Other authorities agree, stating “publication of a laboratory&#8217;s work product and data used in . . . analysis, as well as independent replication and validation studies, are essential prerequisites to reliability.”  <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Schwartz,+447+N.W.+2d+422&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,21&amp;case=1711603818802243408&amp;scilh=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>State v. Schwartz</em></a>, 447 N.W. 2d 422, 428 (Minn. Sup. Ct. 1989) (citing standards set out by the Technical Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods, a group of 31 scientists coordinated by the FBI). Some commentators suggest that laboratory protocols should be publicly available and even placed on the internet. P. Giannelli, E. Imwinkelried, et al., 1 <a href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/store/catalog/booktemplate/productdetail.jsp?pageName=relatedProducts&amp;prodId=7575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scientific Evidence</a> §3.02, p. 160 (5th ed., Dec. 2012).<a title="" href="#_ftn3"><br />
</a></p>
<p>“[N]o one disputes that the procedures such an expert actually employs are discoverable.” <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=cole+v.+state,+835+a.2d+600&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,21&amp;case=18337717452595120703&amp;scilh=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Cole v. State</i></a>, 835 A. 2d 600, 609 (Md. Ct. of App., 2003). While some methods may be theoretically valid, a particular analysis may fall short. Giannelli and Imwinkelried paraphrase the late scientific expert Melvin Lewis as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is no more correct to say that (GC/MS) detects (a drug) than to say that a violin produces music. Unfortunately, it is much easier for unsound scientific opinion to appear valid than for the product of an incompetently manipulated violin to sound euphonic.” <a title="" href="#_ftn5"><br />
</a></p></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proficiency Reports, Calibration and Maintenance Records</span></b></p>
<p>Proficiency reports should be discoverable as they are important to help the court determine the weight to give to the forensic analyst’s conclusions. As the court explained in <em>Cole</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The calibration record for the machine the chemist used and the chemist&#8217;s own proficiency testing records with regard to the specific testing devices and written procedures are potentially relevant to the case because an improperly calibrated machine or a machine operated by a chemist who was not proficient in its use could lead to an inaccurate result.”<a title="" href="#_ftn7"><br />
</a></p></blockquote>
<div>
<p>Requesting laboratory information is not a panacea, however. In my recent experience, DC prosecutors have amended charges to &#8220;attempted&#8221; possession rather than producing this information &#8211; in &#8220;attempted&#8221; possession, the government doesn&#8217;t have to prove that the seized substance is an illegal drug, but it does have to prove that the defendant intended to possess a drug.</p>
<p>In some cases, such as where the government is going on a theory of &#8220;constructive&#8221; possession (the drugs aren&#8217;t seen on the defendant, but the government claims defendant has control of them), this raises the burden of proof on the prosecutors a bit. This may put the defense in a better position for trial or make the prosecutors more willing to give a better plea offer. There&#8217;s nothing to be lost in asking for this lab info, and much that can be gained.</p>

I was very disheartened to see that when it came time for the DEA chemist&#8217;s testimony, the defense lawyer did not challenge her qualifications, did not challenge the identification of the seized evidence as marijuana, and did not cross-examine the chemist <em>at all</em>, not even to have the chemist at least list the procedures performed, etc.<span id="more-362"></span></p>
<p>And unfortunately, this is the normal standard procedure: every day in courts around the country, defense lawyers play chicken with the government; the defense exercises its confrontation clause rights and insists that the government call the chemist hoping for a no-show, but doesn&#8217;t do anything when she does show. The government (and frankly, most judges) would prefer that we just trust the black box of its pseudo-science: this is X drug, because we, the experts, say so.</p>
<p>Civil lawyers intuitively know that experts are fallible, usually in favor of the party paying, and judges also know to treat expert testimony <em>in civil cases</em> with skepticism. But this skepticism goes out the window in criminal cases. If the forensic crime lab scandals of the past few years have taught us nothing else, it&#8217;s that we can&#8217;t trust the government&#8217;s &#8220;scientific experts&#8221; to be unbiased.   Defendants, our clients, deserve more.<!--more--></p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.thetakeaway.org/2012/dec/03/crime-lab-chemist-allegedly-tampered-evidence-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent Massachusetts forensic</a> <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2012/09/30/how-chemist-drug-lab-scandal-circumvented-safeguards/A29LZnAw1eW4hvjn4xX7rL/story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crime lab scandal</a>, <a href="http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/09/annie_dookhan_former_state_che.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Annie Dookhan</a>, a drug chemist, is believed to have falsified test results for many years &#8211; this chemist was responsible for the tests of 60,000 samples in 34,000 criminal cases. Many of those cases resulted in convictions (1,141 inmates have been identified so far). Could better cross-examination have helped uncover her fraud more quickly?</p>
<p>This is something that&#8217;s easy to question in hindsight, but it&#8217;s hard to see how we as defense lawyers can go wrong if we &#8220;QUESTION EVERYTHING&#8221;, as my new hero <a href="http://www.dctrafficattorney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bryan Brown</a> says.*</p>
<p>So, where to start? Another new hero, <a href="http://www.themcshanefirm.com/pa-dui-attorneys/justin-j-mcshane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin McShane</a>, <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/the-myth-of-specific-identification-of-marijuana-in-criminal-court-part-3-what-is-microscopic-morphological-examination-is-it-a-good-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publishes</a> <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/the-myth-of-specific-identification-of-marijuana-in-criminal-court-part-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tons of free</a> <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/mass-spectroscopy-for-lawyers-part-9-other-topics-of-interest-in-gc-ms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">information on the science, or lack thereof</a>, behind drug testing. There&#8217;s lots of fodder for cross-examination there. I am finding that our local DEA lab doesn&#8217;t even want to disclose its practices and standards, so that&#8217;s something we get to fight about. I can also highly recommend Jim Shellow&#8217;s book, <a href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/store/catalog/booktemplate/productdetail.jsp?pageName=relatedProducts&amp;prodId=prod12340326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cross-Examination of the Analyst in Drug Prosecutions</a>. Shellow also wrote <a href="http://www.nacdl.org/Champion.aspx?id=22942" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an article for the Champion</a> (membership req&#8217;d) suggesting that defense lawyers call analysts out for not using the computer matching that most GC/MS machines can do, but rely on subjective spectra matching. Shellow was cited by Scalia in the prophetic <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7136706767059629384&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts</a> majority opinion.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that since I have started pushing on these issues, I can&#8217;t seem to get a drug case to trial. I&#8217;m not reading too much into it, but I can&#8217;t see how one can go wrong by being ready to force the government to prove its case. It&#8217;s what my clients want from me.</p>
<p>* Bryan Brown is one of the primary lawyers responsible for blowing the lid off of the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/09/AR2010060906257.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breathalyzer scandal in DC</a>, so to speak.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In criminal trials, a defendant is judged by people who weren&#8217;t there, didn&#8217;t see what happened, and usually have little experience with the type of crime involved.  What jury could resist testimony from someone who can definitively say that the defendant was guilty of the crime because they committed the crime together?  The accomplice can say: &#8220;I was there,  I know all the details of what happened because I participated in the crime.  I&#8217;m sorry.  The defendant was there and did this too.&#8221;  The problem is that such testimony could be a lie motivated by the prospect of a more lenient sentence.   For that reason, in Maryland, as well as in many other states, convictions may not rest only on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.  <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4848922481367091463&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Watson v. State,</em> 117 A.2d 549, 552 (Md. 1955)</a>,  [WARNING: the facts of some of these cases are quite gruesome, especially <em>Watson</em>].  In this post, I will explore what is called the accomplice corroboration rule as it has been applied in Maryland.  I want to explore a bit about what corroboration is required, what is an accomplice, etc..<span id="more-117"></span></p>
<p>The basis of many criminal procedure and evidentiary rules is that convictions should be supported by reliable evidence (where other criminal procedure rules exclude reliable evidence improperly obtained &#8211; both types of rules seek protect the public from the power of the state).    In <em>Watson</em>, the Maryland Court of Appeals described the problem with accomplice testimony as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reason for the rule requiring the testimony of an accomplice to be  corroborated is that it is the testimony of a person admittedly  contaminated with guilt, who admits his participation in the crime for  which he particularly blames the defendant, and it should be regarded  with great suspicion and caution, because otherwise the life or liberty  of an innocent person might be taken away by a witness who makes the  accusation either to gratify his malice or to shield himself from  punishment, or in the hope of receiving clemency by turning State&#8217;s  evidence.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Watson</em>, 117 A.2d at 552.  Because accomplice testimony usually does not exist without some promise made by the state, some commentators say that prosecutors who present such testimony should bear an extra burden to ensure its truth.  <em>E.g.</em>, Saverda, <em>Accomplices in Federal Court: the Case for Increased Evidentiary Standards</em>, 100 Yale L. J. 785 (1990), <em>available </em><a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/796671" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a> The Maryland Court of Appeals presented a survey of other states&#8217; rules on accomplice testimony in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3608852777050582984&amp;q=corroboration+rule&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,21#[1]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Brown v. State</em>, 378 A. 2d 1104 n.1 (Md. 1977)</a>.</p>
<p>There have been a number of cases that have turned on whether the witness was an accomplice.  <em> </em> An accomplice is someone who has voluntarily participated in the crime, either as a principle or as an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">accessory before the fact.</span> &#8220;The term `accomplice&#8217; does not include a person who has guilty  knowledge, or is morally delinquent, or who was even an admitted  participant in a related but distinct offense.&#8221;  <em>Coleman v. State</em>, 121 A. 2d 254,<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2170671110300352172&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,21&amp;kqfp=11890314658497784986&amp;kql=96&amp;kqpfp=2295347861267889148#kq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 209 Md. 379, 385</a> (1956) (quoting 2 Wharton, <em>Criminal Evidence</em>, 229, Sec. 448, et seq. (12th Ed.)).  &#8220;The test for determining whether a person is an accomplice of a defendant charged with a felony is whether he could be indicted and punished for the crime charged against the defendant.&#8221;<em> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4848922481367091463&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watson</a></em><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4848922481367091463&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">, 117 A.2d at 552-53</a> (accessory after the fact not accomplice); <em>see also <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16907555573402155025&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seward v. State</a></em><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16907555573402155025&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">, 118 A. 2d 505 (Md. 1955)</a> (boy who knew that other boys had bomb and intended to use it when he accompanied them and did not leave was accomplice); <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9229080724877252723&amp;q=corroboration+rule&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>In re Anthony W</em>, 879 A. 2d 717, 733-34</a> (Md. 2005) (boys who participated in theft and trespass not accomplices to separate crime of vandalism).</p>
<p>The next question is what corroboration is required.  The answer is &#8220;[n]ot much in the way of evidence corroborative of the accomplice&#8217;s testimony has been required.&#8221;  <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3608852777050582984&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Brown</em>, 378 A.2d 1104</a>.    Maryland Courts have held &#8220;only slight corroboration is required which would tend either: (1) to identify the defendant with the perpetrators of the crime, or; (2) to show the defendant&#8217;s participation in the crime.&#8221;  <em>Oliver v. State</em>, 454 A. 2d 856, 53 Md. App. 490, 505-06 (1983) (holding officer&#8217;s identification of defendant in close proximity to the crime is adequate corroboration).  That corroboration, however, does have to be from an independent source.  <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1820271961273750258&amp;q=corroboration+rule&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Turner v. State</em>, 452 A. 2d 416 (Md. 1982)</a> (holding that a witness testifying about the accomplice&#8217;s excited utterance is not corroboration).</p>
<p>And the courts are serious that the corroboration required is slight.  In <em>Collins v. State</em>, a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">death-penalty</span> case, the Court of Appeals held that a person who saw two black males leave the scene was sufficient corroboration of the accomplice&#8217;s story of the murder to support a death-penalty conviction (presumably the defendant was black).  <em>Collins v. State</em>, 568 A. 2d 1 (Md. 1990) (&#8220;While Gardner&#8217;s testimony in and of itself was not sufficient to substantiate Collins&#8217; participation in the robbery and subsequent murder, it does provide further corroborative evidence tending to connect Collins and Michie to the crime.&#8221;).  It&#8217;s hard to imagine slighter corroboration than &#8220;two black males.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another death-penalty case, a prison visitation card and a guard&#8217;s testimony that the accomplices visited the defendant in prison on the day that the accomplices stated that the defendant hired them to kill someone was sufficient corroboration to support a murder-for-hire conviction.  <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17656261630339775864&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,21&amp;kqfp=15689549306444375971&amp;kql=85&amp;kqpfp=18429928916369129697#kq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Grandison v. State</em>, 341 Md. 175 (Md. 1995)</a>.  This is slightly more than &#8220;two black males&#8221;, but not much.</p>
<p>While I haven&#8217;t found any decision explicitly stating so, the Court of Appeals&#8217; discussion in <em>Anthony W.</em> seems to assume that having multiple accomplices testify does not satisfy the corroboration requirement, <em>Anthony W.</em>, 879 A.2d at 722, 730, as did the Court of Special Appeals (an intermediate appellate court in Maryland). <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16695160865501122175&amp;q=corroboration+rule&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">859 A. 2d 679, 682</a> (Md. Ct. of Spec. App. 2004).  This would make sense as adding another witness with incentive to lie does not add reliable evidence.</p>
<p>I would welcome any pointers and/or other examples of evidence allowed to fulfill the requirements of the accomplice corroboration rule in Maryland.</p>
