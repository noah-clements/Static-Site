										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s what everyone says they want &#8211; a pitbull on their side. I like pitbulls &#8211; they are intelligent, loving animals. However, that&#8217;s not the image that most people have in mind when thinking of lawyers or what they want &#8211; the picture that comes to mind is a vicious, dangerous killer that will not let go once it sets its teeth in. In the courtroom, this plays out as an attacking, caustic style, one I think is usually counterproductive.</p>
<p>The New York Times has a couple of pieces on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/world/africa/oscar-pistorius-murder-trial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the prosecutor</a> in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/world/africa/pistorius-murder-trial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oscar Pistorious trial</a> (I almost wrote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2dtEXzbKyU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaco Pastorius</a> &#8211; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjS9Y-T589g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he&#8217;s a different kind of killer</a>), who has earned <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/world/africa/oscar-pistorius-murder-trial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">t</a>he nickname &#8220;Pit Bull.&#8221; His style has been described as &#8220;pugnacious&#8221; with &#8220;a reputation for abrasive, in-your-face cross-examination,&#8221; by turns &#8220;sarcastic, theatrical, skeptical and accusatory.&#8221; He has at times called the defendant a liar while testifying. Does this work?</p>
<p><iframe id="nyt_video_player" title="New York Times Video - Embed Player" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/bcvideo/1.0/iframe/embed.html?videoId=100000002818275&amp;playerType=embed" height="373" width="480" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span id="more-569"></span></p>
<p>While Mr. Pistorious may end up convicted, I don&#8217;t think it will be because of the prosecutor&#8217;s &#8220;pitbull&#8221; cross-examination style. At one point in the trial, the judge reprimanded the prosecutor for &#8220;snickering&#8221; at the defendant&#8217;s answer, stating “You possibly think this is entertainment. It is not.” The judge has also warned him to stop calling Mr. Pistorious a liar while he is testifying (this would be grounds for a mistrial in the US). And the  South African Human Rights Commission has received a complaint that the prosecutor&#8217;s &#8220;persistent depiction of Mr. Pistorius as a liar infringed on the runner’s right to be presumed innocent and to have a fair trial.&#8221; (Only one?)</p>
<p>Look at the <a href="http://nyti.ms/1qxOWER" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">short video clip excerpt</a> of the second-day of cross-examination of Mr. Pistorious &#8211; do you think it&#8217;s effective? I thought Mr. Pistorious ended up looking much more sympathetic than he would have without the question.</p>
<p>Terry MacCarthy in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/MacCarthy-Cross-Examination-Terence/dp/1590318862/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1397424991&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=maccarthy+on+cross+examination" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his book </a>on cross-examination says that while defendants and their families may appreciate the attacking cross, the jury &#8220;is muttering to themselves: &#8216;That guy [meaning you] is an ass.&#8221; A prosecutor may get away with it against a defendant, who is seen as deserving this treatment by dint of getting prosecuted. But it doesn&#8217;t seem to work for criminal defense lawyers except against the snitch.</p>
<p>There is a place for determined, aggressive work in criminal defense &#8211; in preparation. Just remember, vicious creatures get put down.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> My friend Jamison Koehler has a great post along the same lines on &#8220;<a href="http://koehlerlaw.net/2014/04/on-the-benefits-of-restraint-during-cross-examination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Benefits of Restraint During Cross-Examination.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p><b>2nd UPDATE: </b>Master criminal defense lawyer Roy Black has <a href="http://www.royblack.com/blog/the-bull-dog-cross/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an entirely different view</a> of the Pistorius cross-examination. Black says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nel is a sarcastic SOB which I enjoy so long as he is not assaulting one of my clients. I have never seen a prosecutor as skilled in the art, but remember this was a judge trial. No rational prosecutor could do an assault like this in front of a jury. They would see it as too over bearing and smack of inspector Javert, but you can’t beat this for pure sadistic enjoyment.</p>
<p>. . . And his method is easy to grasp: He challenges every detail of the story, every claim, every dodge, every obfuscation.</p></blockquote>
<p>While it&#8217;s easy to see why my experiences in bullying a witness can differ from a prosecutor&#8217;s (i.e., the perception that the defendant deserves it), when Roy Black speaks or writes about cross-examination, it&#8217;s a good idea to pay attention. Black&#8217;s post is well worth studying to determine whether any of the techniques used by the prosecutor can be applied by a defense lawyer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many consequences to a drug conviction, some well-known and others not obvious until you face it. One little-known consequence of a drug conviction in DC is that the DC Department of Motor Vehicles will automatically revoke your driver&#8217;s license. DC Code §&nbsp;50-1403.02 requires the DMV to revoke DC driving privileges for any adult or juvenile conviction (or what they call in the juvenile system &#8220;adjudication&#8221;) for a drug offense. This is true whether the drug charge had anything to do with driving or whether you even have a driver&#8217;s license.*<span id="more-552"></span></p>
<p>Unlike many other reasons that the DMV will revoke or suspend a driver&#8217;s license, this provision does not provide for any notice to be given before the revocation (even though taking away a person&#8217;s license without notice is a violation of due process). And many lawyers don&#8217;t tell their clients that they will lose their license if they plead guilty to a drug charge. They should.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions: DC&#8217;s probation before judgment for first offenders under DC Code § 48-904.01(e) and a guilty plea under a deferred sentencing agreement are not considered convictions and should not lead to license revocation.</p>
<p>All in all, this is just another reason to think hard about taking a misdemeanor drug charge to trial rather than pleading guilty. There&#8217;s no such thing as an unwinnable case.</p>
<p>*If you don&#8217;t have a driver&#8217;s license, since there is nothing to take away, the statute says that this will delay the availability of a license for up to two years</p>

<p>A chemist at the DEA Mid-Atlantic Laboratory wrote in a report that three samples suspected to be marijuana turned purple in a <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/the-myth-of-specific-identification-of-marijuana-in-criminal-court-part-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duquenois-Levine color test.</a> The problem is that the picture of the test (not included in the report but in the analyst&#8217;s case-file) showed only one sample that might conceivably indicate the sample was marijuana (and even that one is weak).<span id="more-463"></span></p>
<p>Is there any reason for the analyst to photograph the color test against a green background other than to obscure the real colors obtained? Compare the picture above against an example of what the D-L color test should look like (copied from <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin McShane</a>&#8216;s site for purposes of illustration and comment):</p>
<figure style="width: 312px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/modified-Duquenois-Levine.png?resize=312%2C404" width="312" height="404"  data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This is what a Duquenois-Levine color test of marijuana should look like. The top is purple and the bottom is pink.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #444444; line-height: 1.7;">The truth is that color tests like these are not specific for marijuana, meaning that the test may show a color even if the sample is not marijuana &#8211; there&#8217;s a huge list of plants and chemicals that could cause a purple or purple-ish color. But if there is no color at all, the chemists tell us in their testimony that this would indicate that the sample is not marijuana. So by that token, the lack of color in the test would be evidence that the sample is not marijuana. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #444444; line-height: 1.7;">You can only get this evidence by requesting the information from the government and cross-examining their expert.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though everyone in the DC government, from the DC Council to the prosecutors at the Office of the Attorney General, knows that alcohol in the urine has a &#8220;loose correlation&#8221; to intoxication, that urinalysis is unreliable, people are still regularly prosecuted and convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) base on their urine scores.</p>
<p>Back in June of 2011, DC Chief Toxicologist Lucas Zarwell of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, stated under oath to the DC Council that urine testing cannot reliably determine impairment or blood alcohol levels. In response to a question from council member Phil Mendelson, Mr. Zarwell testified as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>MENDELSON. How accurate is urine testing for measuring blood alcohol content?</p>
<p>ZARWELL. It&#8217;s not.</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FUmhJ_jPF1E" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><span id="more-446"></span>Upon council member Mendelson’s questioning, Mr. Zarwell further explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>MENDELSON. If a urine sample is taken from me and there&#8217;s a high concentration of alcohol in it . . . doesn&#8217;t that suggest that I&#8217;m intoxicated?</p>
<p>ZARWELL. It can. That depends on the officer&#8217;s observations. It can help, I believe, be associated with that. But if you&#8217;re going to look at urine concentrations of alcohol and science, there&#8217;s a very loose correlation. There have been several studies on it. But currently, if you&#8217;re just voiding your urine or urinating into a cup, that does not correlate to a blood concentration. It could be much higher, as much as 40% higher.</p>
<p>MENDELSON. What’s the “it” there? What could be higher?</p>
<p>ZARWELL. The urine concentration could be higher than your blood alcohol concentration, it could be lower than your blood alcohol concentration. . . .</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an old way of doing things. . . . It&#8217;s better to have an officer&#8217;s observations to be able to say, yes, we&#8217;ve got alcohol present. . . .</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s no doubt from a scientific standpoint that blood and breath are a better indicator of, the best indicator to see what kind of effect alcohol is having on the brain. Because the blood is circulating the brain and that&#8217;s where the drug is having its effect and that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re seeing levels of impairment. And this has been studied heavily in the community.</p></blockquote>
<div>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested, you should watch the video. While there was a time that the government prosecutors did not attempt to introduce urine scores, I believe primarily because of confrontation and scheduling issues, that time seems to be over.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s unconscionable that the government is using these urine-alcohol scores in <em>per se </em>DUI prosecutions knowing that they are unreliable. Even worse, DC judges have been denying motions to exclude these scores as unreliable by saying that the DC Council is presumed to have considered the evidence in passing the <em>per se</em> DUI laws (a presumption that is demonstrably false). All we as defense attorneys can do is continue to file these motions in the hope that one day we will be successful. And I continue to aggressively fight this fight for my clients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was consulted on a case the other day where a person had pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession (of something that&#8217;s not marijuana) over his lawyer&#8217;s warnings that it make him removable. The judge also (post-Padilla) made sure that the person knew that there could be immigration consequences. But all the person could hear was that the prosecutor would be asking for probation if he accepted the plea deal (which was also the likely sentence even after trial).</p>
<p>So you can guess what happened. After an ill-advised trip abroad, the person received a Notice to Appear in immigration court. As a legal permanent resident with medical issues, he was eligible for cancellation of removal (which he ended up getting, with a sympathetic judge). But it could easily have gone the other way. Cancellation is a discretionary remedy, which means that the judge could have denied it if he had a good reason to do so.<span id="more-429"></span></p>
<p>I would recommend that a legal permanent resident or anyone else who is not a citizen do <a title="In Drug Cases, Cross-Examine that “Expert”!" href="http://new.theclementsfirm.com/in-drug-cases-cross-examine-that-expert/">everything</a> <a title="Why It’s Important To Get Drug Lab Info In Drug Cases" href="http://new.theclementsfirm.com/why-its-important-to-get-drug-lab-info-in-drug-cases/">possible</a> to <a title="If a Misdemeanor Could Lead to Removal of a Non-Citizen, the Charge *Might Be* Jury-Demandable In DC" href="http://new.theclementsfirm.com/if-a-misdemeanor-could-lead-to-removal-of-a-non-citizen-the-charge-might-be-jury-demandable-in-dc/">fight</a> getting a controlled substance conviction, which makes a person removable under the immigration laws  (and in most cases, I recommend that citizens also fight). When you plead guilty you have a 100% chance of conviction. Unless you are getting a significant benefit (having the government drop other charges, etc), it rarely makes sense to plead guilty to a misdemeanor possession charge. There may be grounds for a motion to surpress the arrest and evidence and you never know, the government witnesses may fail to show for trial.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>It is often truly said that many of our best lawyers . . . are withdrawing from court practice because the nature of the litigation is changing. To such an extent is this change taking place in some localities that the more important commercial cases rarely reach a court decision. Our merchants prefer to compromise their difficulties, or to write off their losses, rather than enter into litigations that must remain dormant in the courts for upward of three years awaiting their turn for a hearing on the overcrowded court calendars.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>When the public realizes that a good trial lawyer is the outcome, one might say of generations of witnesses, when clients fully appreciate the dangers they run in intrusting their litigations to so-called “office lawyers&#8221; with little or no experience in court, they will insist upon their briefs being intrusted to those who make a specialty of court practice. . . .</p></blockquote>
