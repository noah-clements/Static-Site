I think that would be great - as it is now, it&#039;s impossible to know beforehand whether there will be a lot of trial calls before your status hearing. I suspect that some judges keep the status hearings in with the trial calls so that when there is some reason to pass on a few trial calls (as often happens), there will be something for them to do.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know the frustration.  But part of the problem is that we ask defendants to get there at a certain time and then make them wait sometimes for hours before their case is called.  They may not be so eager on getting there on time for the next listing.  One way to reduce the wait would be to do what some judges already do informally; that is, stagger the cases scheduled for status.  For example, you could do trial calls at 9:00 am, one set of status hearings at 10:00 am, and then another set of hearings at 11:00 am.  Trials could then begin at noon.]]></description>
