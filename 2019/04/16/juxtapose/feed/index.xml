					<description><![CDATA[This is very beautifully written, I had such a hard time during mass on Sunday as feelings or worry, sadness, stress and anger became overwhelming during the opening song, “Why have you abandoned me?” It warms my heart to read your reflection and remember we have to have moments of pain so we appreciate the joy.  It reminds me of flying to NYC and picking you and sweet baby Wiley up for Uncle Jim’s funeral, and the risk and fear of that rental car with bad brakes all the way to G’ville.  So worth all of it for the feeling of home. XO!]]></description>
